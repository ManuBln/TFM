  ......

After analyzing the vmcore, I found this issue is caused by page migration.
The scenario is that, one thread is doing page migration, and we will use the
target page's ->mapping field to save 'anon_vma' pointer between page unmap and
page move, and now the target page is locked and refcount is 1.

Currently, there is another stress-ng thread performing memory hotplug,
attempting to offline the target page that is being migrated. It discovers that
the refcount of this target page is 1, preventing the offline operation, thus
proceeding to dump the page. However, page_mapping() of the target page may
return an incorrect file mapping to crash the system in dump_mapping(), since
the target page->mapping only saves 'anon_vma' pointer without setting
PAGE_MAPPING_ANON flag.

There are seveval ways to fix this issue:
(1) Setting the PAGE_MAPPING_ANON flag for target page's ->mapping when saving
'anon_vma', but this can confuse PageAnon() for PFN walkers, since the target
page has not built mappings yet.
(2) Getting the page lock to call page_mapping() in __dump_page() to avoid crashing
the system, however, there are still some PFN walkers that call page_mapping()
without holding the page lock, such as compaction.
(3) Using target page->private field to save the 'anon_vma' pointer and 2 bits
page state, just as page->mapping records an anonymous page, which can remove
the page_mapping() impact for PFN walkers and also seems a simple way.

So I choose option 3 to fix this issue, and this can also fix other potential
issues for PFN walkers, such as compaction.",'-,5.5,249944,Red Hat Update for kernel (RHSA-2025:1659),3,3,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 19, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,269715075,zpa-connector,10.35.152.51,fe80:0:0:0:ac17:a9c8:6d9a:6502,Refer to Red Hat security advisory RHSA-2025:1659 for updates and patch information.(https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:1659),"CH,Cloud Agent,All",No,No,30,11,"Feb 19, 2025","Feb 19, 2025",RedHat,MEDIUM,High Lateral Movement,Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.4,'-,'-,60,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,251,,"#table cols=""3""

After analyzing the vmcore, I found this issue is caused by page migration.
The scenario is that, one thread is doing page migration, and we will use the
target page's ->mapping field to save 'anon_vma' pointer between page unmap and
page move, and now the target page is locked and refcount is 1.

Currently, there is another stress-ng thread performing memory hotplug,
attempting to offline the target page that is being migrated. It discovers that
the refcount of this target page is 1, preventing the offline operation, thus
proceeding to dump the page. However, page_mapping() of the target page may
return an incorrect file mapping to crash the system in dump_mapping(), since
the target page->mapping only saves 'anon_vma' pointer without setting
PAGE_MAPPING_ANON flag.

There are seveval ways to fix this issue:
(1) Setting the PAGE_MAPPING_ANON flag for target page's ->mapping when saving
'anon_vma', but this can confuse PageAnon() for PFN walkers, since the target
page has not built mappings yet.
(2) Getting the page lock to call page_mapping() in __dump_page() to avoid crashing
the system, however, there are still some PFN walkers that call page_mapping()
without holding the page lock, such as compaction.
(3) Using target page->private field to save the 'anon_vma' pointer and 2 bits
page state, just as page->mapping records an anonymous page, which can remove
the page_mapping() impact for PFN walkers and also seems a simple way.

So I choose option 3 to fix this issue, and this can also fix other potential
issues for PFN walkers, such as compaction.",'-,5.5,249944,Red Hat Update for kernel (RHSA-2025:1659),3,3,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 19, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,174420408,ptdtc-sv-lbn01.portugal.pt,"10.200.8.101,10.200.15.101","fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:20c4,fe80:0:0:0:7db2:727a:78e8:9d97",Refer to Red Hat security advisory RHSA-2025:1659 for updates and patch information.(https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:1659),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,tmp_pt_servers_hva",No,No,30,11,"Feb 19, 2025","Feb 19, 2025",RedHat,MEDIUM,High Lateral Movement,Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.5,'-,'-,58,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,235,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-12797,"Issue summary: Clients using RFC7250 Raw Public Keys (RPKs) to authenticate a
server may fail to notice that the server was not authenticated, because
handshakes don't abort as expected when the SSL_VERIFY_PEER verification mode
is set.

Impact summary: TLS and DTLS connections using raw public keys may be
vulnerable to man-in-middle attacks when server authentication failure is not
detected by clients.

RPKs are disabled by default in both TLS clients and TLS servers.  The issue
only arises when TLS clients explicitly enable RPK use by the server, and the
server, likewise, enables sending of an RPK instead of an X.509 certificate
chain.  The affected clients are those that then rely on the handshake to
fail when the server's RPK fails to match one of the expected public keys,
by setting the verification mode to SSL_VERIFY_PEER.

Clients that enable server-side raw public keys can still find out that raw
public key verification failed by calling SSL_get_verify_result(), and those
that do, and take appropriate action, are not affected.  This issue was
introduced in the initial implementation of RPK support in OpenSSL 3.2.

  ......

After analyzing the vmcore, I found this issue is caused by page migration.
The scenario is that, one thread is doing page migration, and we will use the
target page's ->mapping field to save 'anon_vma' pointer between page unmap and
page move, and now the target page is locked and refcount is 1.

Currently, there is another stress-ng thread performing memory hotplug,
attempting to offline the target page that is being migrated. It discovers that
the refcount of this target page is 1, preventing the offline operation, thus
proceeding to dump the page. However, page_mapping() of the target page may
return an incorrect file mapping to crash the system in dump_mapping(), since
the target page->mapping only saves 'anon_vma' pointer without setting
PAGE_MAPPING_ANON flag.

There are seveval ways to fix this issue:
(1) Setting the PAGE_MAPPING_ANON flag for target page's ->mapping when saving
'anon_vma', but this can confuse PageAnon() for PFN walkers, since the target
page has not built mappings yet.
(2) Getting the page lock to call page_mapping() in __dump_page() to avoid crashing
the system, however, there are still some PFN walkers that call page_mapping()
without holding the page lock, such as compaction.
(3) Using target page->private field to save the 'anon_vma' pointer and 2 bits
page state, just as page->mapping records an anonymous page, which can remove
the page_mapping() impact for PFN walkers and also seems a simple way.

So I choose option 3 to fix this issue, and this can also fix other potential
issues for PFN walkers, such as compaction.",'-,5.5,249944,Red Hat Update for kernel (RHSA-2025:1659),3,3,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 20, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,174413121,ptdtc-sv-aradb1.portugal.pt,"10.88.0.111,10.200.6.111","fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:252b,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:dda0",Refer to Red Hat security advisory RHSA-2025:1659 for updates and patch information.(https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:1659),"PT,Cloud Agent,All",No,No,30,11,"Feb 19, 2025","Feb 19, 2025",RedHat,MEDIUM,High Lateral Movement,Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.4,'-,'-,63,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,337,,"#table cols=""3""

  ......

After analyzing the vmcore, I found this issue is caused by page migration.
The scenario is that, one thread is doing page migration, and we will use the
target page's ->mapping field to save 'anon_vma' pointer between page unmap and
page move, and now the target page is locked and refcount is 1.

Currently, there is another stress-ng thread performing memory hotplug,
attempting to offline the target page that is being migrated. It discovers that
the refcount of this target page is 1, preventing the offline operation, thus
proceeding to dump the page. However, page_mapping() of the target page may
return an incorrect file mapping to crash the system in dump_mapping(), since
the target page->mapping only saves 'anon_vma' pointer without setting
PAGE_MAPPING_ANON flag.

There are seveval ways to fix this issue:
(1) Setting the PAGE_MAPPING_ANON flag for target page's ->mapping when saving
'anon_vma', but this can confuse PageAnon() for PFN walkers, since the target
page has not built mappings yet.
(2) Getting the page lock to call page_mapping() in __dump_page() to avoid crashing
the system, however, there are still some PFN walkers that call page_mapping()
without holding the page lock, such as compaction.
(3) Using target page->private field to save the 'anon_vma' pointer and 2 bits
page state, just as page->mapping records an anonymous page, which can remove
the page_mapping() impact for PFN walkers and also seems a simple way.

So I choose option 3 to fix this issue, and this can also fix other potential
issues for PFN walkers, such as compaction.",'-,5.5,249944,Red Hat Update for kernel (RHSA-2025:1659),3,3,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 19, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,174419604,ptdtc-sv-aramin.portugal.pt,"10.200.8.110,172.17.0.1,172.18.0.1,172.19.0.1","fe80:0:0:0:42:77ff:fe42:1cbe,fe80:0:0:0:42:9eff:fe33:2671,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:f44c,fe80:0:0:0:3853:47ff:fed2:7cf8,fe80:0:0:0:444c:78ff:fecc:b98c",Refer to Red Hat security advisory RHSA-2025:1659 for updates and patch information.(https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:1659),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,tmp_pt_servers_hva",No,No,30,11,"Feb 19, 2025","Feb 19, 2025",RedHat,MEDIUM,High Lateral Movement,Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.5,'-,'-,60,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,249,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-12797,"Issue summary: Clients using RFC7250 Raw Public Keys (RPKs) to authenticate a
server may fail to notice that the server was not authenticated, because
handshakes don't abort as expected when the SSL_VERIFY_PEER verification mode
is set.

Impact summary: TLS and DTLS connections using raw public keys may be
vulnerable to man-in-middle attacks when server authentication failure is not
detected by clients.

RPKs are disabled by default in both TLS clients and TLS servers.  The issue
only arises when TLS clients explicitly enable RPK use by the server, and the
server, likewise, enables sending of an RPK instead of an X.509 certificate
chain.  The affected clients are those that then rely on the handshake to
fail when the server's RPK fails to match one of the expected public keys,
by setting the verification mode to SSL_VERIFY_PEER.

Clients that enable server-side raw public keys can still find out that raw
public key verification failed by calling SSL_get_verify_result(), and those
that do, and take appropriate action, are not affected.  This issue was
introduced in the initial implementation of RPK support in OpenSSL 3.2.

The intent of the verifcation done in check_flush_depedency is to ensure
forward progress during memory reclaim, by flagging cases when either a
memory reclaim process, or a memory reclaim work item is flushed from a
context not marked as memory reclaim safe.

This is correct when flushing, but when called from the
cancel(_delayed)_work_sync() paths it is a false positive because work is
either already running, or will not be running at all. Therefore
cancelling it is safe and we can relax the warning criteria by letting the
helper know of the calling context.

CVE-2024-53088,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

i40e: fix race condition by adding filter's intermediate sync state

Fix a race condition in the i40e driver that leads to MAC/VLAN filters
becoming corrupted and leaking. Address the issue that occurs under
heavy load when multiple threads are concurrently modifying MAC/VLAN
filters by setting mac and port VLAN.

1. Thread T0 allocates a filter in i40e_add_filter() within
        i40e_ndo_set_vf_port_vlan().
2. Thread T1 concurrently frees the filter in __i40e_del_filter() within
        i40e_ndo_set_vf_mac().
3. Subsequently, i40e_service_task() calls i40e_sync_vsi_filters(), which
        refers to the already freed filter memory, causing corruption.

Reproduction steps:
1. Spawn multiple VFs.
2. Apply a concurrent heavy load by running parallel operations to change
        MAC addresses on the VFs and change port VLANs on the host.
3. Observe errors in dmesg:
""Error I40E_AQ_RC_ENOSPC adding RX filters on VF XX,
	please set promiscuous on manually for VF XX"".

Exact code for stable reproduction Intel can't open-source now.

The fix involves implementing a new intermediate filter state,

CVE-2025-21689,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

USB: serial: quatech2: fix null-ptr-deref in qt2_process_read_urb()

This patch addresses a null-ptr-deref in qt2_process_read_urb() due to
an incorrect bounds check in the following:

       if (newport > serial->num_ports) {
               dev_err(&port->dev,
                       ""%s - port change to invalid port: %i\n"",
                       __func__, newport);
               break;
       }

The condition doesn't account for the valid range of the serial->port
buffer, which is from 0 to serial->num_ports - 1. When newport is equal
to serial->num_ports, the assignment of ""port"" in the
following code is out-of-bounds and NULL:

       serial_priv->current_port = newport;
       port = serial->port[serial_priv->current_port];

The fix checks if newport is greater than or equal to serial->num_ports
indicating it is out-of-bounds.",'-,5.5,258350,CentOS Stream Security update for kernel,3,3,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 19, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,149342014,srvdmzcdi16v.czech.ch,10.43.225.218,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feb9:943b,Refer to CentOS security advisory kernel for updates and patch information.(https://kojihub.stream.centos.org/koji/buildinfo?buildID=75129),"CH,Cloud Agent,All",No,No,30,12,"Feb 18, 2025","Feb 17, 2025",CentOS,MEDIUM,High Lateral Movement,CentOS Stream 9,'-,'-,71,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",No,2,340,,"#table cols=""3""

  ......

After analyzing the vmcore, I found this issue is caused by page migration.
The scenario is that, one thread is doing page migration, and we will use the
target page's ->mapping field to save 'anon_vma' pointer between page unmap and
page move, and now the target page is locked and refcount is 1.

Currently, there is another stress-ng thread performing memory hotplug,
attempting to offline the target page that is being migrated. It discovers that
the refcount of this target page is 1, preventing the offline operation, thus
proceeding to dump the page. However, page_mapping() of the target page may
return an incorrect file mapping to crash the system in dump_mapping(), since
the target page->mapping only saves 'anon_vma' pointer without setting
PAGE_MAPPING_ANON flag.

There are seveval ways to fix this issue:
(1) Setting the PAGE_MAPPING_ANON flag for target page's ->mapping when saving
'anon_vma', but this can confuse PageAnon() for PFN walkers, since the target
page has not built mappings yet.
(2) Getting the page lock to call page_mapping() in __dump_page() to avoid crashing
the system, however, there are still some PFN walkers that call page_mapping()
without holding the page lock, such as compaction.
(3) Using target page->private field to save the 'anon_vma' pointer and 2 bits
page state, just as page->mapping records an anonymous page, which can remove
the page_mapping() impact for PFN walkers and also seems a simple way.

So I choose option 3 to fix this issue, and this can also fix other potential
issues for PFN walkers, such as compaction.",'-,5.5,249944,Red Hat Update for kernel (RHSA-2025:1659),3,3,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 19, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,174416656,ptdtc-sv-apdb1.portugal.pt,10.200.6.61,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:843a,Refer to Red Hat security advisory RHSA-2025:1659 for updates and patch information.(https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:1659),"PT,Cloud Agent,All",No,No,30,11,"Feb 19, 2025","Feb 19, 2025",RedHat,MEDIUM,High Lateral Movement,Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.5,'-,'-,63,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,340,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-12797,"Issue summary: Clients using RFC7250 Raw Public Keys (RPKs) to authenticate a
server may fail to notice that the server was not authenticated, because
handshakes don't abort as expected when the SSL_VERIFY_PEER verification mode
is set.

Impact summary: TLS and DTLS connections using raw public keys may be
vulnerable to man-in-middle attacks when server authentication failure is not
detected by clients.

RPKs are disabled by default in both TLS clients and TLS servers.  The issue
only arises when TLS clients explicitly enable RPK use by the server, and the
server, likewise, enables sending of an RPK instead of an X.509 certificate
chain.  The affected clients are those that then rely on the handshake to
fail when the server's RPK fails to match one of the expected public keys,
by setting the verification mode to SSL_VERIFY_PEER.

Clients that enable server-side raw public keys can still find out that raw
public key verification failed by calling SSL_get_verify_result(), and those
that do, and take appropriate action, are not affected.  This issue was
introduced in the initial implementation of RPK support in OpenSSL 3.2.

The intent of the verifcation done in check_flush_depedency is to ensure
forward progress during memory reclaim, by flagging cases when either a
memory reclaim process, or a memory reclaim work item is flushed from a
context not marked as memory reclaim safe.

This is correct when flushing, but when called from the
cancel(_delayed)_work_sync() paths it is a false positive because work is
either already running, or will not be running at all. Therefore
cancelling it is safe and we can relax the warning criteria by letting the
helper know of the calling context.

mm/mempolicy: fix migrate_to_node() assuming there is at least one VMA in a MM

We currently assume that there is at least one VMA in a MM, which isn't

So we might end up having find_vma() return NULL, to then de-reference
NULL.  So properly handle find_vma() returning NULL.

CVE-2024-53088,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

i40e: fix race condition by adding filter's intermediate sync state

Fix a race condition in the i40e driver that leads to MAC/VLAN filters
becoming corrupted and leaking. Address the issue that occurs under
heavy load when multiple threads are concurrently modifying MAC/VLAN
filters by setting mac and port VLAN.

1. Thread T0 allocates a filter in i40e_add_filter() within
        i40e_ndo_set_vf_port_vlan().
2. Thread T1 concurrently frees the filter in __i40e_del_filter() within
        i40e_ndo_set_vf_mac().
3. Subsequently, i40e_service_task() calls i40e_sync_vsi_filters(), which
        refers to the already freed filter memory, causing corruption.

Reproduction steps:
1. Spawn multiple VFs.
2. Apply a concurrent heavy load by running parallel operations to change
        MAC addresses on the VFs and change port VLANs on the host.
3. Observe errors in dmesg:
""Error I40E_AQ_RC_ENOSPC adding RX filters on VF XX,
	please set promiscuous on manually for VF XX"".

Exact code for stable reproduction Intel can't open-source now.

The fix involves implementing a new intermediate filter state,
I40E_FILTER_NEW_SYNC, for the time when a filter is on a tmp_add_list.
These filters cannot be deleted from the hash list directly but
must be removed using the full process.",'-,4.7,258350,CentOS Stream Security update for kernel,3,3,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 18, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,149355761,srvdmzcdi17v.czech.ch,10.43.225.219,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feb9:292c,Refer to CentOS security advisory kernel for updates and patch information.(https://kojihub.stream.centos.org/koji/buildinfo?buildID=75129),"CH,Cloud Agent,All",No,No,'-,12,"Feb 18, 2025","Feb 17, 2025",CentOS,MEDIUM,High Lateral Movement,CentOS Stream 9,'-,'-,65,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",No,2,340,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2025-21689,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

USB: serial: quatech2: fix null-ptr-deref in qt2_process_read_urb()

This patch addresses a null-ptr-deref in qt2_process_read_urb() due to
an incorrect bounds check in the following:

       if (newport > serial->num_ports) {
               dev_err(&port->dev,
                       ""%s - port change to invalid port: %i\n"",
                       __func__, newport);
               break;
       }

The condition doesn't account for the valid range of the serial->port
buffer, which is from 0 to serial->num_ports - 1. When newport is equal
to serial->num_ports, the assignment of ""port"" in the
following code is out-of-bounds and NULL:

       serial_priv->current_port = newport;
       port = serial->port[serial_priv->current_port];

CVE-2024-12797,"Issue summary: Clients using RFC7250 Raw Public Keys (RPKs) to authenticate a
server may fail to notice that the server was not authenticated, because
handshakes don't abort as expected when the SSL_VERIFY_PEER verification mode
is set.

Impact summary: TLS and DTLS connections using raw public keys may be
vulnerable to man-in-middle attacks when server authentication failure is not
detected by clients.

RPKs are disabled by default in both TLS clients and TLS servers.  The issue
only arises when TLS clients explicitly enable RPK use by the server, and the
server, likewise, enables sending of an RPK instead of an X.509 certificate
chain.  The affected clients are those that then rely on the handshake to
fail when the server's RPK fails to match one of the expected public keys,
by setting the verification mode to SSL_VERIFY_PEER.

Clients that enable server-side raw public keys can still find out that raw
public key verification failed by calling SSL_get_verify_result(), and those
that do, and take appropriate action, are not affected.  This issue was
introduced in the initial implementation of RPK support in OpenSSL 3.2.

The intent of the verifcation done in check_flush_depedency is to ensure
forward progress during memory reclaim, by flagging cases when either a
memory reclaim process, or a memory reclaim work item is flushed from a
context not marked as memory reclaim safe.

This is correct when flushing, but when called from the
cancel(_delayed)_work_sync() paths it is a false positive because work is
either already running, or will not be running at all. Therefore
cancelling it is safe and we can relax the warning criteria by letting the
helper know of the calling context.

We currently assume that there is at least one VMA in a MM, which isn't

NULL.  So properly handle find_vma() returning NULL.

CVE-2024-53088,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

i40e: fix race condition by adding filter's intermediate sync state

Fix a race condition in the i40e driver that leads to MAC/VLAN filters
becoming corrupted and leaking. Address the issue that occurs under
heavy load when multiple threads are concurrently modifying MAC/VLAN
filters by setting mac and port VLAN.

1. Thread T0 allocates a filter in i40e_add_filter() within
        i40e_ndo_set_vf_port_vlan().
2. Thread T1 concurrently frees the filter in __i40e_del_filter() within
        i40e_ndo_set_vf_mac().
3. Subsequently, i40e_service_task() calls i40e_sync_vsi_filters(), which
        refers to the already freed filter memory, causing corruption.

Reproduction steps:
1. Spawn multiple VFs.
2. Apply a concurrent heavy load by running parallel operations to change
        MAC addresses on the VFs and change port VLANs on the host.
3. Observe errors in dmesg:
""Error I40E_AQ_RC_ENOSPC adding RX filters on VF XX,
	please set promiscuous on manually for VF XX"".

Exact code for stable reproduction Intel can't open-source now.

The fix involves implementing a new intermediate filter state,
I40E_FILTER_NEW_SYNC, for the time when a filter is on a tmp_add_list.

USB: serial: quatech2: fix null-ptr-deref in qt2_process_read_urb()

This patch addresses a null-ptr-deref in qt2_process_read_urb() due to
an incorrect bounds check in the following:

following code is out-of-bounds and NULL:

CVE-2024-12797,"Issue summary: Clients using RFC7250 Raw Public Keys (RPKs) to authenticate a
server may fail to notice that the server was not authenticated, because
handshakes don't abort as expected when the SSL_VERIFY_PEER verification mode
is set.

Impact summary: TLS and DTLS connections using raw public keys may be
vulnerable to man-in-middle attacks when server authentication failure is not
detected by clients.

RPKs are disabled by default in both TLS clients and TLS servers.  The issue
only arises when TLS clients explicitly enable RPK use by the server, and the
server, likewise, enables sending of an RPK instead of an X.509 certificate
chain.  The affected clients are those that then rely on the handshake to
fail when the server's RPK fails to match one of the expected public keys,
by setting the verification mode to SSL_VERIFY_PEER.

Clients that enable server-side raw public keys can still find out that raw
public key verification failed by calling SSL_get_verify_result(), and those
that do, and take appropriate action, are not affected.  This issue was
introduced in the initial implementation of RPK support in OpenSSL 3.2.

CVE-2025-21669,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vsock/virtio: discard packets if the transport changes

If the socket has been de-assigned or assigned to another transport,
we must discard any packets received because they are not expected
and would cause issues when we access vsk->transport.

A possible scenario is described by Hyunwoo Kim in the attached link,

The intent of the verifcation done in check_flush_depedency is to ensure
forward progress during memory reclaim, by flagging cases when either a
memory reclaim process, or a memory reclaim work item is flushed from a
context not marked as memory reclaim safe.

This is correct when flushing, but when called from the
cancel(_delayed)_work_sync() paths it is a false positive because work is
either already running, or will not be running at all. Therefore
cancelling it is safe and we can relax the warning criteria by letting the
helper know of the calling context.

CVE-2024-56611,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/mempolicy: fix migrate_to_node() assuming there is at least one VMA in a MM

We currently assume that there is at least one VMA in a MM, which isn't
true.

So we might end up having find_vma() return NULL, to then de-reference
NULL.  So properly handle find_vma() returning NULL.

This fixes the report:

heavy load when multiple threads are concurrently modifying MAC/VLAN
filters by setting mac and port VLAN.

1. Thread T0 allocates a filter in i40e_add_filter() within
        i40e_ndo_set_vf_port_vlan().
2. Thread T1 concurrently frees the filter in __i40e_del_filter() within
        i40e_ndo_set_vf_mac().
3. Subsequently, i40e_service_task() calls i40e_sync_vsi_filters(), which
        refers to the already freed filter memory, causing corruption.

Reproduction steps:
1. Spawn multiple VFs.
2. Apply a concurrent heavy load by running parallel operations to change
        MAC addresses on the VFs and change port VLANs on the host.
3. Observe errors in dmesg:
""Error I40E_AQ_RC_ENOSPC adding RX filters on VF XX,
	please set promiscuous on manually for VF XX"".

Exact code for stable reproduction Intel can't open-source now.

The fix involves implementing a new intermediate filter state,
I40E_FILTER_NEW_SYNC, for the time when a filter is on a tmp_add_list.
These filters cannot be deleted from the hash list directly but
must be removed using the full process.",'-,4.7,258350,CentOS Stream Security update for kernel,3,3,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 19, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,149342029,srvdmzcdi32v.czech.ch,"10.43.225.217,172.17.0.1,172.20.0.1","fe80:0:0:0:42:9dff:fe5b:d81b,fe80:0:0:0:42:efff:fed8:1601,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feb9:6d5f,fe80:0:0:0:808:c1ff:fee8:8c2c,fe80:0:0:0:81e:eaff:fe51:c4d5,fe80:0:0:0:c55:10ff:fe2c:6a97,fe80:0:0:0:144c:3aff:fe42:716a,fe80:0:0:0:189b:56ff:fed5:8655,fe80:0:0:0:1ce0:97ff:fe0a:e75e,fe80:0:0:0:203b:9aff:fe52:1e42,fe80:0:0:0:342d:30ff:fefa:b7eb,fe80:0:0:0:38f7:51ff:fe4c:cb31,fe80:0:0:0:4018:38ff:fe18:ea10,fe80:0:0:0:489d:82ff:fe0b:3baf,fe80:0:0:0:58c2:7ff:fe50:282b,fe80:0:0:0:600f:3aff:fe85:50d4,fe80:0:0:0:6cbf:6ff:fef2:bb33,fe80:0:0:0:7028:36ff:fe51:99af,fe80:0:0:0:74b6:90ff:fe5a:f1fd,fe80:0:0:0:74be:b0ff:fe3c:b8df,fe80:0:0:0:80c4:e9ff:fe10:ef44,fe80:0:0:0:84a8:e5ff:fe5e:b0c3,fe80:0:0:0:84cb:ceff:fe45:7eb5,fe80:0:0:0:88cd:b9ff:fea0:a42d,fe80:0:0:0:8c49:37ff:febc:1a6a,fe80:0:0:0:9459:caff:fe41:ce07,fe80:0:0:0:bc63:c0ff:fe91:c815,fe80:0:0:0:bc77:48ff:fe31:8672,fe80:0:0:0:c8c1:67ff:fe0b:130a,fe80:0:0:0:dcd0:dfff:feb5:788b,fe80:0:0:0:e09f:86ff:feb1:ea17,fe80:0:0:0:f814:73ff:fe82:d796",Refer to CentOS security advisory kernel for updates and patch information.(https://kojihub.stream.centos.org/koji/buildinfo?buildID=75129),"CH,Cloud Agent,All",No,No,'-,12,"Feb 18, 2025","Feb 17, 2025",CentOS,MEDIUM,High Lateral Movement,CentOS Stream 9,'-,'-,65,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",No,2,340,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2025-21689,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

USB: serial: quatech2: fix null-ptr-deref in qt2_process_read_urb()

This patch addresses a null-ptr-deref in qt2_process_read_urb() due to
an incorrect bounds check in the following:

       if (newport > serial->num_ports) {
               dev_err(&port->dev,
                       ""%s - port change to invalid port: %i\n"",
                       __func__, newport);
               break;
       }

The condition doesn't account for the valid range of the serial->port
buffer, which is from 0 to serial->num_ports - 1. When newport is equal
to serial->num_ports, the assignment of ""port"" in the
following code is out-of-bounds and NULL:

       serial_priv->current_port = newport;
       port = serial->port[serial_priv->current_port];

CVE-2025-0677,"A flaw was found in grub2. When performing a symlink lookup, the grub's UFS module checks the inode's data size to allocate the internal buffer to read the file content, however, it fails to check if the symlink data size has overflown. When this occurs, grub_malloc() may be called with a smaller value than needed. When further reading the data from the disk into the buffer, the grub_ufs_lookup_symlink() function will write past the end of the allocated size. An attack can leverage this by crafting a malicious filesystem, and as a result, it will corrupt data stored in the heap, allowing for arbitrary code execution used to by-pass secure boot mechanisms.",'-,6.4,258354,CentOS Stream Security update for grub2,3,3,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 20, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,149342029,srvdmzcdi32v.czech.ch,"10.43.225.217,172.17.0.1,172.20.0.1","fe80:0:0:0:42:9dff:fe5b:d81b,fe80:0:0:0:42:efff:fed8:1601,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feb9:6d5f,fe80:0:0:0:808:c1ff:fee8:8c2c,fe80:0:0:0:81e:eaff:fe51:c4d5,fe80:0:0:0:c55:10ff:fe2c:6a97,fe80:0:0:0:144c:3aff:fe42:716a,fe80:0:0:0:189b:56ff:fed5:8655,fe80:0:0:0:1ce0:97ff:fe0a:e75e,fe80:0:0:0:203b:9aff:fe52:1e42,fe80:0:0:0:342d:30ff:fefa:b7eb,fe80:0:0:0:38f7:51ff:fe4c:cb31,fe80:0:0:0:4018:38ff:fe18:ea10,fe80:0:0:0:489d:82ff:fe0b:3baf,fe80:0:0:0:58c2:7ff:fe50:282b,fe80:0:0:0:600f:3aff:fe85:50d4,fe80:0:0:0:6cbf:6ff:fef2:bb33,fe80:0:0:0:7028:36ff:fe51:99af,fe80:0:0:0:74b6:90ff:fe5a:f1fd,fe80:0:0:0:74be:b0ff:fe3c:b8df,fe80:0:0:0:80c4:e9ff:fe10:ef44,fe80:0:0:0:84a8:e5ff:fe5e:b0c3,fe80:0:0:0:84cb:ceff:fe45:7eb5,fe80:0:0:0:88cd:b9ff:fea0:a42d,fe80:0:0:0:8c49:37ff:febc:1a6a,fe80:0:0:0:9459:caff:fe41:ce07,fe80:0:0:0:bc63:c0ff:fe91:c815,fe80:0:0:0:bc77:48ff:fe31:8672,fe80:0:0:0:c8c1:67ff:fe0b:130a,fe80:0:0:0:dcd0:dfff:feb5:788b,fe80:0:0:0:e09f:86ff:feb1:ea17,fe80:0:0:0:f814:73ff:fe82:d796",Refer to CentOS security advisory grub2 for updates and patch information.(https://kojihub.stream.centos.org/koji/buildinfo?buildID=75207),"CH,Cloud Agent,All",No,No,30,10,"Feb 20, 2025","Feb 19, 2025",CentOS,HIGH,High Lateral Movement,CentOS Stream 9,'-,'-,54,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",No,2,340,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-12797,"Issue summary: Clients using RFC7250 Raw Public Keys (RPKs) to authenticate a
server may fail to notice that the server was not authenticated, because
handshakes don't abort as expected when the SSL_VERIFY_PEER verification mode
is set.

Impact summary: TLS and DTLS connections using raw public keys may be
vulnerable to man-in-middle attacks when server authentication failure is not
detected by clients.

RPKs are disabled by default in both TLS clients and TLS servers.  The issue
only arises when TLS clients explicitly enable RPK use by the server, and the
server, likewise, enables sending of an RPK instead of an X.509 certificate
chain.  The affected clients are those that then rely on the handshake to
fail when the server's RPK fails to match one of the expected public keys,
by setting the verification mode to SSL_VERIFY_PEER.

Clients that enable server-side raw public keys can still find out that raw
public key verification failed by calling SSL_get_verify_result(), and those
that do, and take appropriate action, are not affected.  This issue was
introduced in the initial implementation of RPK support in OpenSSL 3.2.

CVE-2024-53171,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ubifs: authentication: Fix use-after-free in ubifs_tnc_end_commit

After an insertion in TNC, the tree might split and cause a node to
change its `znode->parent`. A further deletion of other nodes in the
tree (which also could free the nodes), the aforementioned node's
`znode->cparent` could still point to a freed node. This
`znode->cparent` may not be updated when getting nodes to commit in
`ubifs_tnc_start_commit()`. This could then trigger a use-after-free
when accessing the `znode->cparent` in `write_index()` in
`ubifs_tnc_end_commit()`.

This can be triggered by running

  rm -f /etc/test-file.bin
  dd if=/dev/urandom of=/etc/test-file.bin bs=1M count=60 conv=fsync

in a loop, and with `CONFIG_UBIFS_FS_AUTHENTICATION`. KASAN then

The offending `memcpy()` in `ubifs_copy_hash()` has a use-after-free
when a node becomes root in TNC but still has a `cparent` to an already
freed node. More specifically, consider the following TNC:

         zroot
         /
        /
      zp1
      /
     /
    zn

Inserting a new node `zn_new` with a key smaller then `zn` will trigger
a split in `tnc_insert()` if `zp1` is full:

         zroot
         /   \
        /     \
      zp1     zp2
      /         \
     /           \
  zn_new          zn

`zn->parent` has now been moved to `zp2`, *but* `zn->cparent` still
points to `zp1`.

Now, consider a removal of all the nodes _except_ `zn`. Just when
`tnc_delete()` is about to delete `zroot` and `zp2`:

         zroot
             \
              \
              zp2
                \
                 \
                 zn

`zroot` and `zp2` get freed and the tree collapses:

           zn

`zn` now becomes the new `zroot`.

`get_znodes_to_commit()` will now only find `zn`, the new `zroot`, and
`write_index()` will check its `znode->cparent` that wrongly points to
the already freed `zp1`. `ubifs_copy_hash()` thus gets wrongly called
with `znode->cparent->zbranch[znode->iip].hash` that triggers the
use-after-free!

Fix this by explicitly setting `znode->cparent` to `NULL` in
`get_znodes_to_commit()` for the root node. The search for the dirty
nodes

InodeType size from the length. Fix this problem and correctly subtract

warning when `exp_get` is called. To resolve this issue, use
`cache_get_rcu` to ensure that `exp` remains active.

To fix this issue:
  1. Hold rcu lock as accessing ftrace pages in ftrace_location_range();
  2. Use ftrace_location_range() instead of lookup_rec() in
     ftrace_location();
  3. Call synchronize_rcu() before freeing any ftrace pages both in

net: hns3: fix kernel crash when uninstalling driver

When the driver is uninstalled and the VF is disabled concurrently, a
kernel crash occurs. The reason is that the two actions call function
pci_disable_sriov(). The num_VFs is checked to determine whether to
release the corresponding resources. During the second calling, num_VFs
is not 0 and the resource release function is called. However, the
corresponding resource has been released during the first invoking.

CVE-2024-53063,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: dvbdev: prevent the risk of out of memory access

The dvbdev contains a static variable used to store dvb minors.

The behavior of it depends if CONFIG_DVB_DYNAMIC_MINORS is set
or not. When not set, dvb_register_device() won't check for
boundaries, as it will rely that a previous call to
dvb_register_adapter() would already be enforcing it.

On a similar way, dvb_device_open() uses the assumption
that the register functions already did the needed checks.

This can be fragile if some device ends using different
calls. This also generate warnings on static check analysers
like Coverity.

So, add explicit guards to prevent potential risk of OOM issues.",'-,5.5,162327,Oracle Enterprise Linux Security Update for unbreakable enterprise kernel (ELSA-2025-20100),4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 18, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,132178047,ptdtc-sv-c21db1.portugal.pt,"10.88.0.50,10.200.1.53,10.200.6.50","fe80:0:0:0:3ca0:c74c:e466:f2b3,fe80:0:0:0:5ff7:826a:f102:5cf9,fe80:0:0:0:617e:611c:9a77:11ab","To resolve this issue, upgrade to the latest packages which contain a patch.Refer to Oracle Enterprise Linux advisory below for updates and patch information:ELSA-2025-20100(https://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2025-20100.html)","PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT,Group-7",No,No,'-,12,"Feb 17, 2025","Feb 12, 2025",OEL,HIGH,"High Lateral Movement,Privilege Escalation,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Oracle Enterprise Linux 7.9,'-,'-,66,Successful exploitation allows an attacker to compromise the system.,Yes,2,340,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-53214,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vfio/pci: Properly hide first-in-list PCIe extended capability

There are cases where a PCIe extended capability should be hidden from
the user. For example, an unknown capability (i.e., capability with ID
greater than PCI_EXT_CAP_ID_MAX) or a capability that is intentionally
chosen to be hidden from the user.

Hiding a capability is done by virtualizing and modifying the 'Next
Capability Offset' field of the previous capability so it points to the
capability after the one that should be hidden.

The special case where the first capability in the list should be hidden
is handled differently because there is no previous capability that can
be modified. In this case, the capability ID and version are zeroed
while leaving the next pointer intact. This hides the capability and
leaves an anchor for the rest of the capability list.

However, today, hiding the first capability in the list is not done
properly if the capability is unknown, as struct
vfio_pci_core_device->pci_config_map is set to the capability ID during
initialization but the capability ID is not properly checked later when
used in vfio_config_do_rw(). This leads to the following warning [1] and
to an out-of-bounds access to ecap_perms array.

Fix it by checking cap_id in vfio_config_do_rw(), and if it is greater
than PCI_EXT_CAP_ID_MAX, use an alternative struct perm_bits for direct
read only access instead of the ecap_perms array.

Note that this is safe since the above is the only case where cap_id can
exceed PCI_EXT_CAP_ID_MAX (except for the special capabilities, which
are already checked before).

ALSA: usb-audio: Fix out of bounds reads when finding clock sources

The current USB-audio driver code doesn't check bLength of each
descriptor at traversing for clock descriptors.  That is, when a
device provides a bogus descriptor with a shorter bLength, the driver
might hit out-of-bounds reads.

For addressing it, this patch adds sanity checks to the validator
functions for the clock descriptor traversal.  When the descriptor
length is shorter than expected, it's skipped in the loop.

For the clock source and clock multiplier descriptors, we can just
check bLength against the sizeof() of each descriptor type.
OTOH, the clock selector descriptor of UAC2 and UAC3 has an array
of bNrInPins elements and two more fields at its tail, hence those
have to be checked in addition to the sizeof() check.",'-,7.1,162327,Oracle Enterprise Linux Security Update for unbreakable enterprise kernel (ELSA-2025-20100),4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 18, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,132178047,ptdtc-sv-c21db1.portugal.pt,"10.88.0.50,10.200.1.53,10.200.6.50","fe80:0:0:0:3ca0:c74c:e466:f2b3,fe80:0:0:0:5ff7:826a:f102:5cf9,fe80:0:0:0:617e:611c:9a77:11ab","To resolve this issue, upgrade to the latest packages which contain a patch.Refer to Oracle Enterprise Linux advisory below for updates and patch information:ELSA-2025-20100(https://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2025-20100.html)","PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT,Group-7",No,No,35,12,"Feb 17, 2025","Feb 12, 2025",OEL,HIGH,"High Lateral Movement,Privilege Escalation,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Oracle Enterprise Linux 7.9,'-,'-,66,Successful exploitation allows an attacker to compromise the system.,Yes,2,340,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-50278,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dm cache: fix potential out-of-bounds access on the first resume

Out-of-bounds access occurs if the fast device is expanded unexpectedly
before the first-time resume of the cache table. This happens because
expanding the fast device requires reloading the cache table for
cache_create to allocate new in-core data structures that fit the new
size, and the check in cache_preresume is not performed during the
first resume, leading to the issue.

Reproduce steps:

1. prepare component devices:

dmsetup create cmeta --table ""0 8192 linear /dev/sdc 0""
dmsetup create cdata --table ""0 65536 linear /dev/sdc 8192""
dmsetup create corig --table ""0 524288 linear /dev/sdc 262144""
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/mapper/cmeta bs=4k count=1 oflag=direct

2. load a cache table of 512 cache blocks, and deliberately expand the
   fast device before resuming the cache, making the in-core data
   structures inadequate.

dmsetup create cache --notable
dmsetup reload cache --table ""0 524288 cache /dev/mapper/cmeta \
/dev/mapper/cdata /dev/mapper/corig 128 2 metadata2 writethrough smq 0""
dmsetup reload cdata --table ""0 131072 linear /dev/sdc 8192""
dmsetup resume cdata
dmsetup resume cache

3. suspend the cache to write out the in-core dirty bitset and hint
   array, leading to out-of-bounds access to the dirty bitset at offset
   0x40:

dmsetup suspend cache

CVE-2024-50273,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: reinitialize delayed ref list after deleting it from the list

At insert_delayed_ref() if we need to update the action of an existing
ref to BTRFS_DROP_DELAYED_REF, we delete the ref from its ref head's
ref_add_list using list_del(), which leaves the ref's add_list member
not reinitialized, as list_del() sets the next and prev members of the
list to LIST_POISON1 and LIST_POISON2, respectively.

If later we end up calling drop_delayed_ref() against the ref, which can
happen during merging or when destroying delayed refs due to a transaction
abort, we can trigger a crash since at drop_delayed_ref() we call
list_empty() against the ref's add_list, which returns false since
the list was not reinitialized after the list_del() and as a consequence
we call list_del() again at drop_delayed_ref(). This results in an
invalid list access since the next and prev members are set to poison
pointers, resulting in a splat if CONFIG_LIST_HARDENED and
CONFIG_DEBUG_LIST are set or invalid poison pointer dereferences
otherwise.

CVE-2024-56531,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: caiaq: Use snd_card_free_when_closed() at disconnection

The USB disconnect callback is supposed to be short and not too-long
waiting.  OTOH, the current code uses snd_card_free() at
disconnection, but this waits for the close of all used fds, hence it
can take long.  It eventually blocks the upper layer USB ioctls, which
may trigger a soft lockup.

An easy workaround is to replace snd_card_free() with
snd_card_free_when_closed().  This variant returns immediately while
the release of resources is done asynchronously by the card device
release at the last close.

This patch also splits the code to the disconnect and the free phases;
the former is called immediately at the USB disconnect callback while
the latter is called from the card destructor.",'-,'-,162327,Oracle Enterprise Linux Security Update for unbreakable enterprise kernel (ELSA-2025-20100),4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 18, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,132178047,ptdtc-sv-c21db1.portugal.pt,"10.88.0.50,10.200.1.53,10.200.6.50","fe80:0:0:0:3ca0:c74c:e466:f2b3,fe80:0:0:0:5ff7:826a:f102:5cf9,fe80:0:0:0:617e:611c:9a77:11ab","To resolve this issue, upgrade to the latest packages which contain a patch.Refer to Oracle Enterprise Linux advisory below for updates and patch information:ELSA-2025-20100(https://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2025-20100.html)","PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT,Group-7",No,No,'-,12,"Feb 17, 2025","Feb 12, 2025",OEL,HIGH,"High Lateral Movement,Privilege Escalation,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Oracle Enterprise Linux 7.9,'-,'-,66,Successful exploitation allows an attacker to compromise the system.,Yes,2,340,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-56532,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: us122l: Use snd_card_free_when_closed() at disconnection

The USB disconnect callback is supposed to be short and not too-long
waiting.  OTOH, the current code uses snd_card_free() at
disconnection, but this waits for the close of all used fds, hence it
can take long.  It eventually blocks the upper layer USB ioctls, which
may trigger a soft lockup.

An easy workaround is to replace snd_card_free() with
snd_card_free_when_closed().  This variant returns immediately while
the release of resources is done asynchronously by the card device
release at the last close.

The loop of us122l->mmap_count check is dropped as well.  The check is
useless for the asynchronous operation with *_when_closed().",'-,'-,162327,Oracle Enterprise Linux Security Update for unbreakable enterprise kernel (ELSA-2025-20100),4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 18, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,132178047,ptdtc-sv-c21db1.portugal.pt,"10.88.0.50,10.200.1.53,10.200.6.50","fe80:0:0:0:3ca0:c74c:e466:f2b3,fe80:0:0:0:5ff7:826a:f102:5cf9,fe80:0:0:0:617e:611c:9a77:11ab","To resolve this issue, upgrade to the latest packages which contain a patch.Refer to Oracle Enterprise Linux advisory below for updates and patch information:ELSA-2025-20100(https://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2025-20100.html)","PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT,Group-7",No,No,'-,12,"Feb 17, 2025","Feb 12, 2025",OEL,HIGH,"High Lateral Movement,Privilege Escalation,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Oracle Enterprise Linux 7.9,'-,'-,66,Successful exploitation allows an attacker to compromise the system.,Yes,2,340,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-56670,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: gadget: u_serial: Fix the issue that gs_start_io crashed due to accessing null pointer

Considering that in some extreme cases,
when u_serial driver is accessed by multiple threads,
Thread A is executing the open operation and calling the gs_open,
Thread B is executing the disconnect operation and calling the
gserial_disconnect function,The port->port_usb pointer will be set to NULL.

E.g.
    Thread A                                 Thread B
    gs_open()                                gadget_unbind_driver()
    gs_start_io()                            composite_disconnect()
    gs_start_rx()                            gserial_disconnect()
    ...                                      ...
    spin_unlock(&port->port_lock)
    status = usb_ep_queue()                  spin_lock(&port->port_lock)
    spin_lock(&port->port_lock)              port->port_usb = NULL
    gs_free_requests(port->port_usb->in)     spin_unlock(&port->port_lock)
    Crash

This causes thread A to access a null pointer (port->port_usb is null)
when calling the gs_free_requests function, causing a crash.

If port_usb is NULL, the release request will be skipped as it
will be done by gserial_disconnect.

So add a null pointer check to gs_start_io before attempting
to access the value of the pointer port->port_usb.

CVE-2024-56548,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

hfsplus: don't query the device logical block size multiple times

Devices block sizes may change. One of these cases is a loop device by
using ioctl LOOP_SET_BLOCK_SIZE.

While this may cause other issues like IO being rejected, in the case of
hfsplus, it will allocate a block by using that size and potentially write
out-of-bounds when hfsplus_read_wrapper calls hfsplus_submit_bio and the
latter function reads a different io_size.

Using a new min_io_size initally set to sb_min_blocksize works for the
purposes of the original fix, since it will be set to the max between
HFSPLUS_SECTOR_SIZE and the first seen logical block size. We still use the
max between HFSPLUS_SECTOR_SIZE and min_io_size in case the latter is not
initialized.

Tested by mounting an hfsplus filesystem with loop block sizes 512, 1024
and 4096.

The produced KASAN report before the fix looks like this:

CVE-2024-56700,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: wl128x: Fix atomicity violation in fmc_send_cmd()

Atomicity violation occurs when the fmc_send_cmd() function is executed
simultaneously with the modification of the fmdev->resp_skb value.
Consider a scenario where, after passing the validity check within the
function, a non-null fmdev->resp_skb variable is assigned a null value.
This results in an invalid fmdev->resp_skb variable passing the validity
check. As seen in the later part of the function, skb = fmdev->resp_skb;
when the invalid fmdev->resp_skb passes the check, a null pointer
dereference error may occur at line 478, evt_hdr = (void *)skb->data;

To address this issue, it is recommended to include the validity check of
fmdev->resp_skb within the locked section of the function. This
modification ensures that the value of fmdev->resp_skb does not change
during the validation process, thereby maintaining its validity.

This possible bug is found by an experimental static analysis tool
developed by our team. This tool analyzes the locking APIs
to extract function pairs that can be concurrently executed, and then
analyzes the instructions in the paired functions to identify possible
concurrency bugs including data races and atomicity violations.",'-,'-,162327,Oracle Enterprise Linux Security Update for unbreakable enterprise kernel (ELSA-2025-20100),4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 18, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,132178047,ptdtc-sv-c21db1.portugal.pt,"10.88.0.50,10.200.1.53,10.200.6.50","fe80:0:0:0:3ca0:c74c:e466:f2b3,fe80:0:0:0:5ff7:826a:f102:5cf9,fe80:0:0:0:617e:611c:9a77:11ab","To resolve this issue, upgrade to the latest packages which contain a patch.Refer to Oracle Enterprise Linux advisory below for updates and patch information:ELSA-2025-20100(https://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2025-20100.html)","PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT,Group-7",No,No,'-,12,"Feb 17, 2025","Feb 12, 2025",OEL,HIGH,"High Lateral Movement,Privilege Escalation,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Oracle Enterprise Linux 7.9,'-,'-,66,Successful exploitation allows an attacker to compromise the system.,Yes,2,340,,"#table cols=""3""

nilfs2: fix null-ptr-deref in block_touch_buffer tracepoint

Patch series ""nilfs2: fix null-ptr-deref bugs on block tracepoints"".

This series fixes null pointer dereference bugs that occur when using
nilfs2 and two block-related tracepoints.


This patch (of 2):

It has been reported that when using ""block:block_touch_buffer""
tracepoint, touch_buffer() called from __nilfs_get_folio_block() causes a
NULL pointer dereference, or a general protection fault when KASAN is
enabled.

This happens because since the tracepoint was added in touch_buffer(), it
references the dev_t member bh->b_bdev->bd_dev regardless of whether the
buffer head has a pointer to a block_device structure.  In the current
implementation, the block_device structure is set after the function
returns to the caller.

Here, touch_buffer() is used to mark the folio/page that owns the buffer
head as accessed, but the common search helper for folio/page used by the
caller function was optimized to mark the folio/page as accessed when it
was reimplemented a long time ago, eliminating the need to call
touch_buffer() here in the first place.

So this solves the issue by eliminating the touch_buffer() call itself.",'-,5.5,162327,Oracle Enterprise Linux Security Update for unbreakable enterprise kernel (ELSA-2025-20100),4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 18, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,132178047,ptdtc-sv-c21db1.portugal.pt,"10.88.0.50,10.200.1.53,10.200.6.50","fe80:0:0:0:3ca0:c74c:e466:f2b3,fe80:0:0:0:5ff7:826a:f102:5cf9,fe80:0:0:0:617e:611c:9a77:11ab","To resolve this issue, upgrade to the latest packages which contain a patch.Refer to Oracle Enterprise Linux advisory below for updates and patch information:ELSA-2025-20100(https://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2025-20100.html)","PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT,Group-7",No,No,30,12,"Feb 17, 2025","Feb 12, 2025",OEL,HIGH,"High Lateral Movement,Privilege Escalation,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Oracle Enterprise Linux 7.9,'-,'-,66,Successful exploitation allows an attacker to compromise the system.,Yes,2,340,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-53130,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nilfs2: fix null-ptr-deref in block_dirty_buffer tracepoint

When using the ""block:block_dirty_buffer"" tracepoint, mark_buffer_dirty()
may cause a NULL pointer dereference, or a general protection fault when
KASAN is enabled.

This happens because, since the tracepoint was added in
mark_buffer_dirty(), it references the dev_t member bh->b_bdev->bd_dev
regardless of whether the buffer head has a pointer to a block_device
structure.

In the current implementation, nilfs_grab_buffer(), which grabs a buffer
to read (or create) a block of metadata, including b-tree node blocks,
does not set the block device, but instead does so only if the buffer is
not in the ""uptodate"" state for each of its caller block reading
functions.  However, if the uptodate flag is set on a folio/page, and the
buffer heads are detached from it by try_to_free_buffers(), and new buffer
heads are then attached by create_empty_buffers(), the uptodate flag may
be restored to each buffer without the block device being set to
bh->b_bdev, and mark_buffer_dirty() may be called later in that state,
resulting in the bug mentioned above.

Fix this issue by making nilfs_grab_buffer() always set the block device
of the super block structure to the buffer head, regardless of the state
of the buffer's uptodate flag.",'-,5.5,162327,Oracle Enterprise Linux Security Update for unbreakable enterprise kernel (ELSA-2025-20100),4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 18, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,132178047,ptdtc-sv-c21db1.portugal.pt,"10.88.0.50,10.200.1.53,10.200.6.50","fe80:0:0:0:3ca0:c74c:e466:f2b3,fe80:0:0:0:5ff7:826a:f102:5cf9,fe80:0:0:0:617e:611c:9a77:11ab","To resolve this issue, upgrade to the latest packages which contain a patch.Refer to Oracle Enterprise Linux advisory below for updates and patch information:ELSA-2025-20100(https://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2025-20100.html)","PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT,Group-7",No,No,30,12,"Feb 17, 2025","Feb 12, 2025",OEL,HIGH,"High Lateral Movement,Privilege Escalation,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Oracle Enterprise Linux 7.9,'-,'-,66,Successful exploitation allows an attacker to compromise the system.,Yes,2,340,,"#table cols=""3""

tcp_bpf: Fix the sk_mem_uncharge logic in tcp_bpf_sendmsg

The current sk memory accounting logic in __SK_REDIRECT is pre-uncharging
tosend bytes, which is either msg->sg.size or a smaller value apply_bytes.

Potential problems with this strategy are as follows:

- If the actual sent bytes are smaller than tosend, we need to charge some
  bytes back, as in line 487, which is okay but seems not clean.

- When tosend is set to apply_bytes, as in line 417, and (ret < 0), we may
  miss uncharging (msg->sg.size - apply_bytes) bytes.

[...]
415 tosend = msg->sg.size;
416 if (psock->apply_bytes && psock->apply_bytes < tosend)
417   tosend = psock->apply_bytes;

CVE-2024-53140,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netlink: terminate outstanding dump on socket close

Netlink supports iterative dumping of data. It provides the families
the following ops:
 - start - (optional) kicks off the dumping process
 - dump  - actual dump helper, keeps getting called until it returns 0
 - done  - (optional) pairs with .start, can be used for cleanup
The whole process is asynchronous and the repeated calls to .dump
don't actually happen in a tight loop, but rather are triggered
in response to recvmsg() on the socket.

This gives the user full control over the dump, but also means that
the user can close the socket without getting to the end of the dump.
To make sure .start is always paired with .done we check if there
is an ongoing dump before freeing the socket, and if so call .done.

The complication is that sockets can get freed from BH and .done
is allowed to sleep. So we use a workqueue to defer the call, when
needed.

Unfortunately this does not work correctly. What we defer is not
the cleanup but rather releasing a reference on the socket.
We have no guarantee that we own the last reference, if someone
else holds the socket they may release it in BH and we're back
to square one.

The whole dance, however, appears to be unnecessary. Only the user
can interact with dumps, so we can clean up when socket is closed.
And close always happens in process context. Some async code may
still access the socket after close, queue notification skbs to it etc.
but no dumps can start, end or otherwise make progress.

Delete the workqueue and flush the dump state directly from the release
handler. Note that further cleanup is possible in -next, for instance
we now always call .done before releasing the main module reference,
so dump doesn't have to take a reference of its own.",'-,5.5,162327,Oracle Enterprise Linux Security Update for unbreakable enterprise kernel (ELSA-2025-20100),4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 18, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,132178047,ptdtc-sv-c21db1.portugal.pt,"10.88.0.50,10.200.1.53,10.200.6.50","fe80:0:0:0:3ca0:c74c:e466:f2b3,fe80:0:0:0:5ff7:826a:f102:5cf9,fe80:0:0:0:617e:611c:9a77:11ab","To resolve this issue, upgrade to the latest packages which contain a patch.Refer to Oracle Enterprise Linux advisory below for updates and patch information:ELSA-2025-20100(https://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2025-20100.html)","PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT,Group-7",No,No,30,12,"Feb 17, 2025","Feb 12, 2025",OEL,HIGH,"High Lateral Movement,Privilege Escalation,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Oracle Enterprise Linux 7.9,'-,'-,66,Successful exploitation allows an attacker to compromise the system.,Yes,2,340,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-53142,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

initramfs: avoid filename buffer overrun

The initramfs filename field is defined in
Documentation/driver-api/early-userspace/buffer-format.rst as:

 37 cpio_file := ALGN(4) + cpio_header + filename + ""\0"" + ALGN(4) + data
...
 55 ============= ================== =========================
 56 Field name    Field size         Meaning
 57 ============= ================== =========================
...
 70 c_namesize    8 bytes            Length of filename, including final \0

When extracting an initramfs cpio archive, the kernel's do_name() path
handler assumes a zero-terminated path at @collected, passing it
directly to filp_open() / init_mkdir() / init_mknod().

If a specially crafted cpio entry carries a non-zero-terminated filename
and is followed by uninitialized memory, then a file may be created with
trailing characters that represent the uninitialized memory. The ability
to create an initramfs entry would imply already having full control of
the system, so the buffer overrun shouldn't be considered a security
vulnerability.

Append the output of the following bash script to an existing initramfs
and observe any created /initramfs_test_fname_overrunAA* path. E.g.
  ./reproducer.sh | gzip >> /myinitramfs

It's easiest to observe non-zero uninitialized memory when the output is
gzipped, as it'll overflow the heap allocated @out_buf in __gunzip(),
rather than the initrd_start+initrd_size block.

anyway. But the following 'rc' check is wrong and execution flow do
'ocfs2_xa_remove_entry(loc);' twice:

This issue was also reported by syzbot.

It can be reproduced by following these steps(more details [1]):
1. Obtain more than 32 inputs that have similar hashes, which ends with the
   pattern '0xxxxxxxe6'.
2. Reboot and add the keys obtained in step 1.

The reproducer demonstrates how this issue happened:
1. In the search_nested_keyrings function, when it iterates through the
   slots in a node(below tag ascend_to_node), if the slot pointer is meta
   and node->back_pointer != NULL(it means a root), it will proceed to
   descend_to_node. However, there is an exception. If node is the root,
   and one of the slots points to a shortcut, it will be treated as a
   keyring.
2. Whether the ptr is keyring decided by keyring_ptr_is_keyring function.
   However, KEYRING_PTR_SUBTYPE is 0x2UL, the same as
   ASSOC_ARRAY_PTR_SUBTYPE_MASK.
3. When 32 keys with the similar hashes are added to the tree, the ROOT
   has keys with hashes that are not similar (e.g. slot 0) and it splits
   NODE A without using a shortcut. When NODE A is filled with keys that
   all hashes are xxe6, the keys are similar, NODE A will split with a
   shortcut. Finally, it forms the tree as shown below, where slot 6 points
   to a shortcut.

                      NODE A
              +------>+---+
      ROOT    |       | 0 | xxe6
      +---+   |       +---+
 xxxx | 0 | shortcut  :   : xxe6
      +---+   |       +---+
 xxe6 :   :   |       |   | xxe6
      +---+   |       +---+
      | 6 |---+       :   : xxe6
      +---+           +---+
 xxe6 :   :           | f | xxe6
      +---+           +---+
 xxe6 | f |
      +---+

4. As mentioned above, If a slot(slot 6) of the root points to a shortcut,
   it may be mistakenly transferred to a key*, leading to a read
   out-of-bounds read.

To fix this issue, one should jump to descend_to_node if the ptr is a
shortcut, regardless of whether the node is root or not.

CVE-2024-53135,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: VMX: Bury Intel PT virtualization (guest/host mode) behind CONFIG_BROKEN

Hide KVM's pt_mode module param behind CONFIG_BROKEN, i.e. disable support
for virtualizing Intel PT via guest/host mode unless BROKEN=y.  There are
myriad bugs in the implementation, some of which are fatal to the guest,
and others which put the stability and health of the host at risk.

For guest fatalities, the most glaring issue is that KVM fails to ensure
tracing is disabled, and *stays* disabled prior to VM-Enter, which is
necessary as hardware disallows loading (the guest's) RTIT_CTL if tracing
is enabled (enforced via a VMX consistency check).  Per the SDM:

  If the logical processor is operating with Intel PT enabled (if
  IA32_RTIT_CTL.TraceEn = 1) at the time of VM entry, the ""load
  IA32_RTIT_CTL"" VM-entry control must be 0.

On the host side, KVM doesn't validate the guest CPUID configuration
provided by userspace, and even worse, uses the guest configuration to
decide what MSRs to save/load at VM-Enter and VM-Exit.  E.g. configuring
guest CPUID to enumerate more address ranges than are supported in hardware
will result in KVM trying to passthrough, save, and load non-existent MSRs,
which generates a variety of WARNs, ToPA ERRORs in the host, a potential
deadlock, etc.",'-,6.5,162327,Oracle Enterprise Linux Security Update for unbreakable enterprise kernel (ELSA-2025-20100),4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 18, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,132178047,ptdtc-sv-c21db1.portugal.pt,"10.88.0.50,10.200.1.53,10.200.6.50","fe80:0:0:0:3ca0:c74c:e466:f2b3,fe80:0:0:0:5ff7:826a:f102:5cf9,fe80:0:0:0:617e:611c:9a77:11ab","To resolve this issue, upgrade to the latest packages which contain a patch.Refer to Oracle Enterprise Linux advisory below for updates and patch information:ELSA-2025-20100(https://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2025-20100.html)","PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT,Group-7",No,No,30,12,"Feb 17, 2025","Feb 12, 2025",OEL,HIGH,"High Lateral Movement,Privilege Escalation,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Oracle Enterprise Linux 7.9,'-,'-,66,Successful exploitation allows an attacker to compromise the system.,Yes,2,340,,"#table cols=""3""

tipc: Fix use-after-free of kernel socket in cleanup_bearer().

syzkaller reported a use-after-free of UDP kernel socket
in cleanup_bearer() without repro. [0][1]

When bearer_disable() calls tipc_udp_disable(), cleanup
of the UDP kernel socket is deferred by work calling
cleanup_bearer().

tipc_exit_net() waits for such works to finish by checking
tipc_net(net)->wq_count.  However, the work decrements the
count too early before releasing the kernel socket,
unblocking cleanup_net() and resulting in use-after-free.

Let's move the decrement after releasing the socket in
cleanup_bearer().

CVE-2024-53194,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

PCI: Fix use-after-free of slot->bus on hot remove

Dennis reports a boot crash on recent Lenovo laptops with a USB4 dock.

Since commit 0fc70886569c (""thunderbolt: Reset USB4 v2 host router"") and
commit 59a54c5f3dbd (""thunderbolt: Reset topology created by the boot
firmware""), USB4 v2 and v1 Host Routers are reset on probe of the
thunderbolt driver.

The reset clears the Presence Detect State and Data Link Layer Link Active
bits at the USB4 Host Router's Root Port and thus causes hot removal of the
dock.

The crash occurs when pciehp is unbound from one of the dock's Downstream
Ports:  pciehp creates a pci_slot on bind and destroys it on unbind.  The
pci_slot contains a pointer to the pci_bus below the Downstream Port, but
a reference on that pci_bus is never acquired.  The pci_bus is destroyed
before the pci_slot, so a use-after-free ensues when pci_slot_release()
accesses slot->bus.

In principle this should not happen because pci_stop_bus_device() unbinds
pciehp (and therefore destroys the pci_slot) before the pci_bus is
destroyed by pci_remove_bus_device().

However the stacktrace provided by Dennis shows that pciehp is unbound from
pci_remove_bus_device() instead of pci_stop_bus_device().  To understand
the significance of this, one needs to know that the PCI core uses a two
step process to remove a portion of the hierarchy:  It first unbinds all
drivers in the sub-hierarchy in pci_stop_bus_device() and then actually
removes the devices in pci_remove_bus_device().  There is no precaution to
prevent driver binding in-between pci_stop_bus_device() and
pci_remove_bus_device().

In Dennis' case, it seems removal of the hierarchy by pciehp races with
driver binding by pci_bus_add_devices().  pciehp is bound to the
Downstream Port after pci_stop_bus_device() has run, so it is unbound by
pci_remove_bus_device() instead of pci_stop_bus_device().  Because the
pci_bus has already been destroyed at that point, accesses to it result in
a use-after-free.

One might conclude that driver binding needs to be prevented after
pci_stop_bus_device() has run.  However it seems risky that pci_slot points
to pci_bus without holding a reference.  Solely relying on correct ordering
of driver unbind versus pci_bus destruction is certainly not defensive
programming.

If pci_slot has a need to access data in pci_bus, it ought to acquire a
reference.  Amend pci_create_slot() accordingly.  Dennis reports that the
crash is not reproducible with this change.

CVE-2024-56581,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: ref-verify: fix use-after-free after invalid ref action

At btrfs_ref_tree_mod() after we successfully inserted the new ref entry
(local variable 'ref') into the respective block entry's rbtree (local
variable 'be'), if we find an unexpected action of BTRFS_DROP_DELAYED_REF,
we error out and free the ref entry without removing it from the block
entry's rbtree. Then in the error path of btrfs_ref_tree_mod() we call
btrfs_free_ref_cache(), which iterates over all block entries and then
calls free_block_entry() for each one, and there we will trigger a
use-after-free when we are called against the block entry to which we
added the freed ref entry to its rbtree, since the rbtree still points
to the block entry, as we didn't remove it from the rbtree before freeing
it in the error path at btrfs_ref_tree_mod(). Fix this by removing the
new ref entry from the rbtree before freeing it.

CVE-2024-56615,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: fix OOB devmap writes when deleting elements

Jordy reported issue against XSKMAP which also applies to DEVMAP - the
index used for accessing map entry, due to being a signed integer,
causes the OOB writes. Fix is simple as changing the type from int to
u32, however, when compared to XSKMAP case, one more thing needs to be
addressed.

When map is released from system via dev_map_free(), we iterate through
all of the entries and an iterator variable is also an int, which
implies OOB accesses. Again, change it to be u32.

Example splat below:

CVE-2024-56593,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: brcmfmac: Fix oops due to NULL pointer dereference in brcmf_sdiod_sglist_rw()

This patch fixes a NULL pointer dereference bug in brcmfmac that occurs
when a high 'sd_sgentry_align' value applies (e.g. 512) and a lot of queued SKBs
are sent from the pkt queue.

The problem is the number of entries in the pre-allocated sgtable, it is
nents = max(rxglom_size, txglom_size) + max(rxglom_size, txglom_size) >> 4 + 1.
Given the default [rt]xglom_size=32 it's actually 35 which is too small.
Worst case, the pkt queue can end up with 64 SKBs. This occurs when a new SKB
is added for each original SKB if tailroom isn't enough to hold tail_pad.
At least one sg entry is needed for each SKB. So, eventually the ""skb_queue_walk loop""
in brcmf_sdiod_sglist_rw may run out of sg entries. This makes sg_next return
NULL and this causes the oops.

The patch sets nents to max(rxglom_size, txglom_size) * 2 to be able handle
the worst-case.
Btw. this requires only 64-35=29 * 16 (or 20 if CONFIG_NEED_SG_DMA_LENGTH) = 464

CVE-2024-53198,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

xen: Fix the issue of resource not being properly released in xenbus_dev_probe()

This patch fixes an issue in the function xenbus_dev_probe(). In the
xenbus_dev_probe() function, within the if (err) branch at line 313, the
program incorrectly returns err directly without releasing the resources
allocated by err = drv->probe(dev, id). As the return value is non-zero,
the upper layers assume the processing logic has failed. However, the probe
operation was performed earlier without a corresponding remove operation.
Since the probe actually allocates resources, failing to perform the remove
operation could lead to problems.

To fix this issue, we followed the resource release logic of the
xenbus_dev_remove() function by adding a new block fail_remove before the
fail_put block. After entering the branch if (err) at line 313, the
function will use a goto statement to jump to the fail_remove block,
ensuring that the previously acquired resources are correctly released,
thus preventing the reference count leak.

This bug was identified by an experimental static analysis tool developed
by our team. The tool specializes in analyzing reference count operations
and detecting potential issues where resources are not properly managed.
In this case, the tool flagged the missing release operation as a
potential problem, which led to the development of this patch.",'-,'-,162327,Oracle Enterprise Linux Security Update for unbreakable enterprise kernel (ELSA-2025-20100),4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 18, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,132178047,ptdtc-sv-c21db1.portugal.pt,"10.88.0.50,10.200.1.53,10.200.6.50","fe80:0:0:0:3ca0:c74c:e466:f2b3,fe80:0:0:0:5ff7:826a:f102:5cf9,fe80:0:0:0:617e:611c:9a77:11ab","To resolve this issue, upgrade to the latest packages which contain a patch.Refer to Oracle Enterprise Linux advisory below for updates and patch information:ELSA-2025-20100(https://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2025-20100.html)","PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT,Group-7",No,No,'-,12,"Feb 17, 2025","Feb 12, 2025",OEL,HIGH,"High Lateral Movement,Privilege Escalation,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Oracle Enterprise Linux 7.9,'-,'-,66,Successful exploitation allows an attacker to compromise the system.,Yes,2,340,,"#table cols=""3""

inode will failed in f2fs_enable_checkpoint. When umount the file
system after enabling checkpoint, the root inode is dirty in
f2fs_evict_inode function, which triggers BUG_ON. The steps to
reproduce are as follows:

CVE-2024-56587,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

leds: class: Protect brightness_show() with led_cdev->led_access mutex

There is NULL pointer issue observed if from Process A where hid device
being added which results in adding a led_cdev addition and later a
another call to access of led_cdev attribute from Process B can result
in NULL pointer issue.

Use mutex led_cdev->led_access to protect access to led->cdev and its
attribute inside brightness_show() and max_brightness_show() and also
update the comment for mutex that it should be used to protect the led
class device fields.

After analyzing the vmcore, I found this issue is caused by page migration.
The scenario is that, one thread is doing page migration, and we will use the
target page's ->mapping field to save 'anon_vma' pointer between page unmap and
page move, and now the target page is locked and refcount is 1.

Currently, there is another stress-ng thread performing memory hotplug,
attempting to offline the target page that is being migrated. It discovers that
the refcount of this target page is 1, preventing the offline operation, thus
proceeding to dump the page. However, page_mapping() of the target page may
return an incorrect file mapping to crash the system in dump_mapping(), since
the target page->mapping only saves 'anon_vma' pointer without setting
PAGE_MAPPING_ANON flag.

There are seveval ways to fix this issue:
(1) Setting the PAGE_MAPPING_ANON flag for target page's ->mapping when saving
'anon_vma', but this can confuse PageAnon() for PFN walkers, since the target
page has not built mappings yet.
(2) Getting the page lock to call page_mapping() in __dump_page() to avoid crashing
the system, however, there are still some PFN walkers that call page_mapping()
without holding the page lock, such as compaction.
(3) Using target page->private field to save the 'anon_vma' pointer and 2 bits
page state, just as page->mapping records an anonymous page, which can remove
the page_mapping() impact for PFN walkers and also seems a simple way.

So I choose option 3 to fix this issue, and this can also fix other potential
issues for PFN walkers, such as compaction.",'-,5.5,249944,Red Hat Update for kernel (RHSA-2025:1659),3,3,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 20, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,174413128,ptdtc-sv-lbn02.portugal.pt,"10.200.8.102,10.200.15.102","fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:4c96,fe80:0:0:0:d15e:cf71:be28:7b50",Refer to Red Hat security advisory RHSA-2025:1659 for updates and patch information.(https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:1659),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,tmp_pt_servers_hva",No,No,30,11,"Feb 19, 2025","Feb 19, 2025",RedHat,MEDIUM,High Lateral Movement,Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.5,'-,'-,63,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,235,,"#table cols=""3""

the refcount of this target page is 1, preventing the offline operation, thus
proceeding to dump the page. However, page_mapping() of the target page may
return an incorrect file mapping to crash the system in dump_mapping(), since
the target page->mapping only saves 'anon_vma' pointer without setting
PAGE_MAPPING_ANON flag.

There are seveval ways to fix this issue:
(1) Setting the PAGE_MAPPING_ANON flag for target page's ->mapping when saving
'anon_vma', but this can confuse PageAnon() for PFN walkers, since the target
page has not built mappings yet.
(2) Getting the page lock to call page_mapping() in __dump_page() to avoid crashing
the system, however, there are still some PFN walkers that call page_mapping()
without holding the page lock, such as compaction.
(3) Using target page->private field to save the 'anon_vma' pointer and 2 bits
page state, just as page->mapping records an anonymous page, which can remove
the page_mapping() impact for PFN walkers and also seems a simple way.

So I choose option 3 to fix this issue, and this can also fix other potential
issues for PFN walkers, such as compaction.",'-,5.5,249944,Red Hat Update for kernel (RHSA-2025:1659),3,3,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 19, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,151220019,ptdtc-sv-cddb2.portugal.pt,"10.88.0.13,10.200.1.113,10.200.6.72",fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:9afd,Refer to Red Hat security advisory RHSA-2025:1659 for updates and patch information.(https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:1659),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT,Group-7",No,No,30,11,"Feb 19, 2025","Feb 19, 2025",RedHat,MEDIUM,High Lateral Movement,Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.4,'-,'-,64,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,335,,"#table cols=""3""

memory reclaim process, or a memory reclaim work item is flushed from a
context not marked as memory reclaim safe.

This is correct when flushing, but when called from the
cancel(_delayed)_work_sync() paths it is a false positive because work is
either already running, or will not be running at all. Therefore
cancelling it is safe and we can relax the warning criteria by letting the
helper know of the calling context.

CVE-2024-56611,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/mempolicy: fix migrate_to_node() assuming there is at least one VMA in a MM

We currently assume that there is at least one VMA in a MM, which isn't
true.

So we might end up having find_vma() return NULL, to then de-reference
NULL.  So properly handle find_vma() returning NULL.

This fixes the report:

CVE-2024-53088,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

i40e: fix race condition by adding filter's intermediate sync state

Fix a race condition in the i40e driver that leads to MAC/VLAN filters
becoming corrupted and leaking. Address the issue that occurs under
heavy load when multiple threads are concurrently modifying MAC/VLAN
filters by setting mac and port VLAN.

1. Thread T0 allocates a filter in i40e_add_filter() within
        i40e_ndo_set_vf_port_vlan().
2. Thread T1 concurrently frees the filter in __i40e_del_filter() within
        i40e_ndo_set_vf_mac().
3. Subsequently, i40e_service_task() calls i40e_sync_vsi_filters(), which
        refers to the already freed filter memory, causing corruption.

Reproduction steps:
1. Spawn multiple VFs.
2. Apply a concurrent heavy load by running parallel operations to change
        MAC addresses on the VFs and change port VLANs on the host.
3. Observe errors in dmesg:
""Error I40E_AQ_RC_ENOSPC adding RX filters on VF XX,
	please set promiscuous on manually for VF XX"".

Exact code for stable reproduction Intel can't open-source now.

The fix involves implementing a new intermediate filter state,
I40E_FILTER_NEW_SYNC, for the time when a filter is on a tmp_add_list.
These filters cannot be deleted from the hash list directly but
must be removed using the full process.",'-,4.7,258350,CentOS Stream Security update for kernel,3,3,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 18, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,143153569,sppdmzcdi32v.czech.ch,"10.43.225.79,172.17.0.1,172.21.0.1","fe80:0:0:0:42:31ff:fec9:844,fe80:0:0:0:42:deff:fe5a:2bd7,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feb9:173b,fe80:0:0:0:480:55ff:fe40:96eb,fe80:0:0:0:c2c:ecff:fe3a:d396,fe80:0:0:0:10cb:8dff:fe11:a339,fe80:0:0:0:14a5:91ff:fe96:b026,fe80:0:0:0:302b:32ff:fea8:776c,fe80:0:0:0:30d4:35ff:fefa:885c,fe80:0:0:0:3882:1fff:fe4e:e634,fe80:0:0:0:40a9:22ff:feca:f823,fe80:0:0:0:40dc:67ff:feda:352,fe80:0:0:0:40e0:47ff:fef3:cdd1,fe80:0:0:0:4834:62ff:fef1:deea,fe80:0:0:0:6865:e8ff:fea0:a1a4,fe80:0:0:0:7047:42ff:fe12:62f7,fe80:0:0:0:704d:7fff:fef5:5c90,fe80:0:0:0:7856:6bff:fe76:8de6,fe80:0:0:0:78e3:57ff:fedc:944a,fe80:0:0:0:7cd5:c7ff:fec8:f0f1,fe80:0:0:0:8431:1bff:fe5a:327a,fe80:0:0:0:9016:6ff:fec1:5514,fe80:0:0:0:9849:9eff:fe3a:89f,fe80:0:0:0:98af:84ff:fe20:2397,fe80:0:0:0:a47e:6bff:fec2:2f77,fe80:0:0:0:bcdc:d9ff:fe64:6bf8,fe80:0:0:0:c491:2bff:fee5:5e00,fe80:0:0:0:c492:8eff:fe92:e354,fe80:0:0:0:cc4b:71ff:fe34:e0e2,fe80:0:0:0:cc76:7ff:feba:745d,fe80:0:0:0:e0b4:dbff:fe1c:a276",Refer to CentOS security advisory kernel for updates and patch information.(https://kojihub.stream.centos.org/koji/buildinfo?buildID=75129),"CH,Cloud Agent,All",No,No,'-,12,"Feb 18, 2025","Feb 17, 2025",CentOS,MEDIUM,High Lateral Movement,CentOS Stream 9,'-,'-,69,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",No,2,340,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-12797,"Issue summary: Clients using RFC7250 Raw Public Keys (RPKs) to authenticate a
server may fail to notice that the server was not authenticated, because
handshakes don't abort as expected when the SSL_VERIFY_PEER verification mode
is set.

Impact summary: TLS and DTLS connections using raw public keys may be
vulnerable to man-in-middle attacks when server authentication failure is not
detected by clients.

RPKs are disabled by default in both TLS clients and TLS servers.  The issue
only arises when TLS clients explicitly enable RPK use by the server, and the
server, likewise, enables sending of an RPK instead of an X.509 certificate
chain.  The affected clients are those that then rely on the handshake to
fail when the server's RPK fails to match one of the expected public keys,
by setting the verification mode to SSL_VERIFY_PEER.

Clients that enable server-side raw public keys can still find out that raw
public key verification failed by calling SSL_get_verify_result(), and those
that do, and take appropriate action, are not affected.  This issue was
introduced in the initial implementation of RPK support in OpenSSL 3.2.

CVE-2025-0677,"A flaw was found in grub2. When performing a symlink lookup, the grub's UFS module checks the inode's data size to allocate the internal buffer to read the file content, however, it fails to check if the symlink data size has overflown. When this occurs, grub_malloc() may be called with a smaller value than needed. When further reading the data from the disk into the buffer, the grub_ufs_lookup_symlink() function will write past the end of the allocated size.

CVE-2024-12797,"Issue summary: Clients using RFC7250 Raw Public Keys (RPKs) to authenticate a
server may fail to notice that the server was not authenticated, because
handshakes don't abort as expected when the SSL_VERIFY_PEER verification mode
is set.

Impact summary: TLS and DTLS connections using raw public keys may be
vulnerable to man-in-middle attacks when server authentication failure is not
detected by clients.

RPKs are disabled by default in both TLS clients and TLS servers.  The issue
only arises when TLS clients explicitly enable RPK use by the server, and the
server, likewise, enables sending of an RPK instead of an X.509 certificate
chain.  The affected clients are those that then rely on the handshake to
fail when the server's RPK fails to match one of the expected public keys,
by setting the verification mode to SSL_VERIFY_PEER.

Clients that enable server-side raw public keys can still find out that raw
public key verification failed by calling SSL_get_verify_result(), and those
that do, and take appropriate action, are not affected.  This issue was
introduced in the initial implementation of RPK support in OpenSSL 3.2.

The intent of the verifcation done in check_flush_depedency is to ensure
forward progress during memory reclaim, by flagging cases when either a
memory reclaim process, or a memory reclaim work item is flushed from a
context not marked as memory reclaim safe.

This is correct when flushing, but when called from the
cancel(_delayed)_work_sync() paths it is a false positive because work is
either already running, or will not be running at all. Therefore
cancelling it is safe and we can relax the warning criteria by letting the
helper know of the calling context.

mm/mempolicy: fix migrate_to_node() assuming there is at least one VMA in a MM

We currently assume that there is at least one VMA in a MM, which isn't

So we might end up having find_vma() return NULL, to then de-reference
NULL.  So properly handle find_vma() returning NULL.

CVE-2024-53088,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

i40e: fix race condition by adding filter's intermediate sync state

Fix a race condition in the i40e driver that leads to MAC/VLAN filters
becoming corrupted and leaking. Address the issue that occurs under
heavy load when multiple threads are concurrently modifying MAC/VLAN
filters by setting mac and port VLAN.

1. Thread T0 allocates a filter in i40e_add_filter() within
        i40e_ndo_set_vf_port_vlan().
2. Thread T1 concurrently frees the filter in __i40e_del_filter() within
        i40e_ndo_set_vf_mac().
3. Subsequently, i40e_service_task() calls i40e_sync_vsi_filters(), which
        refers to the already freed filter memory, causing corruption.

Reproduction steps:
1. Spawn multiple VFs.
2. Apply a concurrent heavy load by running parallel operations to change
        MAC addresses on the VFs and change port VLANs on the host.
3. Observe errors in dmesg:
""Error I40E_AQ_RC_ENOSPC adding RX filters on VF XX,
	please set promiscuous on manually for VF XX"".

Exact code for stable reproduction Intel can't open-source now.

The fix involves implementing a new intermediate filter state,
I40E_FILTER_NEW_SYNC, for the time when a filter is on a tmp_add_list.
These filters cannot be deleted from the hash list directly but
must be removed using the full process.",'-,4.7,258350,CentOS Stream Security update for kernel,3,3,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 19, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,143139103,sppdmzcdi17v.czech.ch,10.43.225.90,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:fe8b:84ff,Refer to CentOS security advisory kernel for updates and patch information.(https://kojihub.stream.centos.org/koji/buildinfo?buildID=75129),"CH,Cloud Agent,All",No,No,'-,12,"Feb 18, 2025","Feb 17, 2025",CentOS,MEDIUM,High Lateral Movement,CentOS Stream 9,'-,'-,66,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",No,2,338,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2025-21689,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

USB: serial: quatech2: fix null-ptr-deref in qt2_process_read_urb()

This patch addresses a null-ptr-deref in qt2_process_read_urb() due to
an incorrect bounds check in the following:

       if (newport > serial->num_ports) {
               dev_err(&port->dev,

               break;
       }

The condition doesn't account for the valid range of the serial->port
buffer, which is from 0 to serial->num_ports - 1. When newport is equal
to serial->num_ports, the assignment of ""port"" in the
following code is out-of-bounds and NULL:

       serial_priv->current_port = newport;
       port = serial->port[serial_priv->current_port];

CVE-2024-12797,"Issue summary: Clients using RFC7250 Raw Public Keys (RPKs) to authenticate a
server may fail to notice that the server was not authenticated, because
handshakes don't abort as expected when the SSL_VERIFY_PEER verification mode
is set.

Impact summary: TLS and DTLS connections using raw public keys may be
vulnerable to man-in-middle attacks when server authentication failure is not
detected by clients.

RPKs are disabled by default in both TLS clients and TLS servers.  The issue
only arises when TLS clients explicitly enable RPK use by the server, and the
server, likewise, enables sending of an RPK instead of an X.509 certificate
chain.  The affected clients are those that then rely on the handshake to
fail when the server's RPK fails to match one of the expected public keys,
by setting the verification mode to SSL_VERIFY_PEER.

Clients that enable server-side raw public keys can still find out that raw
public key verification failed by calling SSL_get_verify_result(), and those
that do, and take appropriate action, are not affected.  This issue was
introduced in the initial implementation of RPK support in OpenSSL 3.2.

adding a call to scsi_proc_hostdir_rm() on scsi_remove_host(). But that led
to a potential duplicate call to the hostdir_rm() routine, since it's also
called from scsi_host_dev_release(). That triggered a regression report,
which was then fixed by commit be03df3d4bfe (""scsi: core: Fix a procfs host
directory removal regression""). The fix just dropped the hostdir_rm() call
from dev_release().

But it happens that this proc directory is created on scsi_host_alloc(),
and that function ""pairs"" with scsi_host_dev_release(), while
scsi_remove_host() pairs with scsi_add_host(). In other words, it seems the
reason for removing the proc directory on dev_release() was meant to cover
cases in which a SCSI host structure was allocated, but the call to
scsi_add_host() didn't happen. And that pattern happens to exist in some
error paths, for example.

Syzkaller causes that by using USB raw gadget device, error'ing on
usb-storage driver, at usb_stor_probe2(). By checking that path, we can see
that the BadDevice label leads to a scsi_host_put() after a SCSI host
allocation, but there's no call to scsi_add_host() in such path. That leads
to messages like this in dmesg (and a leak of the SCSI host proc
structure):

usb-storage 4-1:87.51: USB Mass Storage device detected

WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 3519 at fs/proc/generic.c:377 proc_register+0x347/0x4e0 fs/proc/generic.c:376

The proper fix seems to still call scsi_proc_hostdir_rm() on dev_release(),
but guard that with the state check for SHOST_CREATED; there is even a
comment in scsi_host_dev_release() detailing that: such conditional is
meant for cases where the SCSI host was allocated but there was no calls to
{add,remove}_host(), like the usb-storage case.

This is what we propose here and with that, the error path of usb-storage

CVE-2024-50275,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64/sve: Discard stale CPU state when handling SVE traps

The logic for handling SVE traps manipulates saved FPSIMD/SVE state
incorrectly, and a race with preemption can result in a task having
TIF_SVE set and TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE clear even though the live CPU state
is stale (e.g. with SVE traps enabled). This has been observed to result
in warnings from do_sve_acc() where SVE traps are not expected while
TIF_SVE is set:

|         if (test_and_set_thread_flag(TIF_SVE))
|                 WARN_ON(1); /* SVE access shouldn't have trapped */

Warnings of this form have been reported intermittently, e.g.

  https://lore.kernel.org/linux-arm-kernel/CA+G9fYtEGe_DhY2Ms7+L7NKsLYUomGsgqpdBj+QwDLeSg=JhGg@mail.gmail.com/
  https://lore.kernel.org/linux-arm-kernel/000000000000511e9a060ce5a45c@google.com/

The race can occur when the SVE trap handler is preempted before and
after manipulating the saved FPSIMD/SVE state, starting and ending on
the same CPU, e.g.

| void do_sve_acc(unsigned long esr, struct pt_regs *regs)
| {
|         // Trap on CPU 0 with TIF_SVE clear, SVE traps enabled
|         // task->fpsimd_cpu is 0.
|         // per_cpu_ptr(&fpsimd_last_state, 0) is task.
|
|         ...
|
|         // Preempted; migrated from CPU 0 to CPU 1.
|         // TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is set.
|
|         get_cpu_fpsimd_context();
|
|         if (test_and_set_thread_flag(TIF_SVE))
|                 WARN_ON(1); /* SVE access shouldn't have trapped */
|
|         sve_init_regs() {
|                 if (!test_thread_flag(TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE)) {
|                         ...
|                 } else {
|                         fpsimd_to_sve(current);
|                         current->thread.fp_type = FP_STATE_SVE;
|                 }
|         }
|
|         put_cpu_fpsimd_context();
|
|         // Preempted; migrated from CPU 1 to CPU 0.
|         // task->fpsimd_cpu is still 0
|         // If per_cpu_ptr(&fpsimd_last_state, 0) is still task then:
|         // - Stale HW state is reused (with SVE traps enabled)
|         // - TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is cleared
|         // - A return to userspace skips HW state restore
| }

Fix the case where the state is not live and TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is set
by calling fpsimd_flush_task_state() to detach from the saved CPU
state. This ensures that a subsequent context switch will not reuse the
stale CPU state, and will instead set TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE, forcing the

CVE-2024-8508,"NLnet Labs Unbound up to and including version 1.21.0 contains a vulnerability when handling replies with very large RRsets that it needs to perform name compression for. Malicious upstreams responses with very large RRsets can cause Unbound to spend a considerable time applying name compression to downstream replies. This can lead to degraded performance and eventually denial of service in well orchestrated attacks. The vulnerability can be exploited by a malicious actor querying Unbound for the specially crafted contents of a malicious zone with very large RRsets. Before Unbound replies to the query it will try to apply name compression which was an unbounded operation that could lock the CPU until the whole packet was complete. Unbound version 1.21.1 introduces a hard limit on the number of name compression calculations it is willing to do per packet. Packets that need more compression will result in semi-compressed packets or truncated packets, even on TCP for huge messages, to avoid locking the CPU for long.

CVE-2024-26935,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: core: Fix unremoved procfs host directory regression

Commit fc663711b944 (""scsi: core: Remove the /proc/scsi/${proc_name}
directory earlier"") fixed a bug related to modules loading/unloading, by
adding a call to scsi_proc_hostdir_rm() on scsi_remove_host(). But that led
to a potential duplicate call to the hostdir_rm() routine, since it's also
called from scsi_host_dev_release(). That triggered a regression report,
which was then fixed by commit be03df3d4bfe (""scsi: core: Fix a procfs host
directory removal regression""). The fix just dropped the hostdir_rm() call
from dev_release().

But it happens that this proc directory is created on scsi_host_alloc(),
and that function ""pairs"" with scsi_host_dev_release(), while
scsi_remove_host() pairs with scsi_add_host(). In other words, it seems the
reason for removing the proc directory on dev_release() was meant to cover
cases in which a SCSI host structure was allocated, but the call to
scsi_add_host() didn't happen. And that pattern happens to exist in some
error paths, for example.

Syzkaller causes that by using USB raw gadget device, error'ing on
usb-storage driver, at usb_stor_probe2(). By checking that path, we can see
that the BadDevice label leads to a scsi_host_put() after a SCSI host
allocation, but there's no call to scsi_add_host() in such path. That leads
to messages like this in dmesg (and a leak of the SCSI host proc
structure):

usb-storage 4-1:87.51: USB Mass Storage device detected
proc_dir_entry 'scsi/usb-storage' already registered
WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 3519 at fs/proc/generic.c:377 proc_register+0x347/0x4e0 fs/proc/generic.c:376

The proper fix seems to still call scsi_proc_hostdir_rm() on dev_release(),
but guard that with the state check for SHOST_CREATED; there is even a
comment in scsi_host_dev_release() detailing that: such conditional is
meant for cases where the SCSI host was allocated but there was no calls to
{add,remove}_host(), like the usb-storage case.

This is what we propose here and with that, the error path of usb-storage
does not trigger the warning anymore.",'-,'-,961539,Rocky Linux Security Update for kernel (RLSA-2025:1068),4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 18, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,257392555,ptdtc-sv-ipam01.portugal.pt,10.208.230.241,,Refer to Rocky Linux security advisory RLSA-2025:1068 for updates and patch information.(https://errata.rockylinux.org/RLSA-2025:1068),"PT,Cloud Agent,All",No,No,'-,12,"Feb 17, 2025","Feb 13, 2025",Rocky Linux,HIGH,High Lateral Movement,Rocky Linux 8.10,'-,'-,64,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability.",No,2,238,,"#table cols=""3""

arm64/sve: Discard stale CPU state when handling SVE traps

The logic for handling SVE traps manipulates saved FPSIMD/SVE state
incorrectly, and a race with preemption can result in a task having
TIF_SVE set and TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE clear even though the live CPU state
is stale (e.g. with SVE traps enabled). This has been observed to result
in warnings from do_sve_acc() where SVE traps are not expected while

CVE-2024-8508,"NLnet Labs Unbound up to and including version 1.21.0 contains a vulnerability when handling replies with very large RRsets that it needs to perform name compression for. Malicious upstreams responses with very large RRsets can cause Unbound to spend a considerable time applying name compression to downstream replies. This can lead to degraded performance and eventually denial of service in well orchestrated attacks. The vulnerability can be exploited by a malicious actor querying Unbound for the specially crafted contents of a malicious zone with very large RRsets. Before Unbound replies to the query it will try to apply name compression which was an unbounded operation that could lock the CPU until the whole packet was complete. Unbound version 1.21.1 introduces a hard limit on the number of name compression calculations it is willing to do per packet. Packets that need more compression will result in semi-compressed packets or truncated packets, even on TCP for huge messages, to avoid locking the CPU for long.

CVE-2024-26935,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: core: Fix unremoved procfs host directory regression

Commit fc663711b944 (""scsi: core: Remove the /proc/scsi/${proc_name}
directory earlier"") fixed a bug related to modules loading/unloading, by
adding a call to scsi_proc_hostdir_rm() on scsi_remove_host(). But that led
to a potential duplicate call to the hostdir_rm() routine, since it's also
called from scsi_host_dev_release(). That triggered a regression report,
which was then fixed by commit be03df3d4bfe (""scsi: core: Fix a procfs host
directory removal regression""). The fix just dropped the hostdir_rm() call
from dev_release().

But it happens that this proc directory is created on scsi_host_alloc(),
and that function ""pairs"" with scsi_host_dev_release(), while
scsi_remove_host() pairs with scsi_add_host(). In other words, it seems the
reason for removing the proc directory on dev_release() was meant to cover
cases in which a SCSI host structure was allocated, but the call to
scsi_add_host() didn't happen. And that pattern happens to exist in some
error paths, for example.

Syzkaller causes that by using USB raw gadget device, error'ing on
usb-storage driver, at usb_stor_probe2(). By checking that path, we can see
that the BadDevice label leads to a scsi_host_put() after a SCSI host
allocation, but there's no call to scsi_add_host() in such path. That leads
to messages like this in dmesg (and a leak of the SCSI host proc
structure):

usb-storage 4-1:87.51: USB Mass Storage device detected
proc_dir_entry 'scsi/usb-storage' already registered
WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 3519 at fs/proc/generic.c:377 proc_register+0x347/0x4e0 fs/proc/generic.c:376

The proper fix seems to still call scsi_proc_hostdir_rm() on dev_release(),
but guard that with the state check for SHOST_CREATED; there is even a
comment in scsi_host_dev_release() detailing that: such conditional is
meant for cases where the SCSI host was allocated but there was no calls to
{add,remove}_host(), like the usb-storage case.

This is what we propose here and with that, the error path of usb-storage
does not trigger the warning anymore.",'-,'-,961539,Rocky Linux Security Update for kernel (RLSA-2025:1068),4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 18, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,132177893,ptdtc-sv-iris04.portugal.pt,10.200.8.201,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:5da0,Refer to Rocky Linux security advisory RLSA-2025:1068 for updates and patch information.(https://errata.rockylinux.org/RLSA-2025:1068),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT,Group-4",No,No,'-,12,"Feb 17, 2025","Feb 13, 2025",Rocky Linux,HIGH,High Lateral Movement,Rocky Linux 8.10,'-,'-,68,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability.",No,2,343,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-50275,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64/sve: Discard stale CPU state when handling SVE traps

The logic for handling SVE traps manipulates saved FPSIMD/SVE state
incorrectly, and a race with preemption can result in a task having
TIF_SVE set and TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE clear even though the live CPU state
is stale (e.g. with SVE traps enabled). This has been observed to result
in warnings from do_sve_acc() where SVE traps are not expected while
TIF_SVE is set:

CVE-2024-8508,"NLnet Labs Unbound up to and including version 1.21.0 contains a vulnerability when handling replies with very large RRsets that it needs to perform name compression for. Malicious upstreams responses with very large RRsets can cause Unbound to spend a considerable time applying name compression to downstream replies. This can lead to degraded performance and eventually denial of service in well orchestrated attacks. The vulnerability can be exploited by a malicious actor querying Unbound for the specially crafted contents of a malicious zone with very large RRsets. Before Unbound replies to the query it will try to apply name compression which was an unbounded operation that could lock the CPU until the whole packet was complete. Unbound version 1.21.1 introduces a hard limit on the number of name compression calculations it is willing to do per packet. Packets that need more compression will result in semi-compressed packets or truncated packets, even on TCP for huge messages, to avoid locking the CPU for long.

CVE-2024-26935,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: core: Fix unremoved procfs host directory regression

Commit fc663711b944 (""scsi: core: Remove the /proc/scsi/${proc_name}
directory earlier"") fixed a bug related to modules loading/unloading, by
adding a call to scsi_proc_hostdir_rm() on scsi_remove_host(). But that led
to a potential duplicate call to the hostdir_rm() routine, since it's also
called from scsi_host_dev_release(). That triggered a regression report,
which was then fixed by commit be03df3d4bfe (""scsi: core: Fix a procfs host
directory removal regression""). The fix just dropped the hostdir_rm() call
from dev_release().

But it happens that this proc directory is created on scsi_host_alloc(),
and that function ""pairs"" with scsi_host_dev_release(), while
scsi_remove_host() pairs with scsi_add_host(). In other words, it seems the
reason for removing the proc directory on dev_release() was meant to cover
cases in which a SCSI host structure was allocated, but the call to
scsi_add_host() didn't happen. And that pattern happens to exist in some
error paths, for example.

Syzkaller causes that by using USB raw gadget device, error'ing on
usb-storage driver, at usb_stor_probe2(). By checking that path, we can see
that the BadDevice label leads to a scsi_host_put() after a SCSI host
allocation, but there's no call to scsi_add_host() in such path. That leads
to messages like this in dmesg (and a leak of the SCSI host proc
structure):

usb-storage 4-1:87.51: USB Mass Storage device detected
proc_dir_entry 'scsi/usb-storage' already registered
WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 3519 at fs/proc/generic.c:377 proc_register+0x347/0x4e0 fs/proc/generic.c:376

The proper fix seems to still call scsi_proc_hostdir_rm() on dev_release(),
but guard that with the state check for SHOST_CREATED; there is even a
comment in scsi_host_dev_release() detailing that: such conditional is
meant for cases where the SCSI host was allocated but there was no calls to
{add,remove}_host(), like the usb-storage case.

This is what we propose here and with that, the error path of usb-storage
does not trigger the warning anymore.",'-,'-,961539,Rocky Linux Security Update for kernel (RLSA-2025:1068),4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 18, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,132181680,ptdtc-sv-iris06.portugal.pt,10.200.8.203,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:c867,Refer to Rocky Linux security advisory RLSA-2025:1068 for updates and patch information.(https://errata.rockylinux.org/RLSA-2025:1068),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT,Group-4",No,No,'-,12,"Feb 17, 2025","Feb 13, 2025",Rocky Linux,HIGH,High Lateral Movement,Rocky Linux 8.10,'-,'-,74,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability.",No,2,341,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-50275,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64/sve: Discard stale CPU state when handling SVE traps

The logic for handling SVE traps manipulates saved FPSIMD/SVE state
incorrectly, and a race with preemption can result in a task having
TIF_SVE set and TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE clear even though the live CPU state
is stale (e.g. with SVE traps enabled). This has been observed to result
in warnings from do_sve_acc() where SVE traps are not expected while
TIF_SVE is set:

|         if (test_and_set_thread_flag(TIF_SVE))
|                 WARN_ON(1); /* SVE access shouldn't have trapped */

Warnings of this form have been reported intermittently, e.g.

  https://lore.kernel.org/linux-arm-kernel/CA+G9fYtEGe_DhY2Ms7+L7NKsLYUomGsgqpdBj+QwDLeSg=JhGg@mail.gmail.com/
  https://lore.kernel.org/linux-arm-kernel/000000000000511e9a060ce5a45c@google.com/

The race can occur when the SVE trap handler is preempted before and
after manipulating the saved FPSIMD/SVE state, starting and ending on
the same CPU, e.g.

| void do_sve_acc(unsigned long esr, struct pt_regs *regs)
| {
|         // Trap on CPU 0 with TIF_SVE clear, SVE traps enabled
|         // task->fpsimd_cpu is 0.
|         // per_cpu_ptr(&fpsimd_last_state, 0) is task.
|
|         ...
|
|         // Preempted; migrated from CPU 0 to CPU 1.
|         // TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is set.
|
|         get_cpu_fpsimd_context();
|
|         if (test_and_set_thread_flag(TIF_SVE))
|                 WARN_ON(1); /* SVE access shouldn't have trapped */
|
|         sve_init_regs() {
|                 if (!test_thread_flag(TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE)) {
|                         ...
|                 } else {
|                         fpsimd_to_sve(current);
|                         current->thread.fp_type = FP_STATE_SVE;
|                 }
|         }
|
|         put_cpu_fpsimd_context();
|
|         // Preempted; migrated from CPU 1 to CPU 0.
|         // task->fpsimd_cpu is still 0
|         // If per_cpu_ptr(&fpsimd_last_state, 0) is still task then:
|         // - Stale HW state is reused (with SVE traps enabled)
|         // - TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is cleared
|         // - A return to userspace skips HW state restore
| }

Fix the case where the state is not live and TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is set
by calling fpsimd_flush_task_state() to detach from the saved CPU
state. This ensures that a subsequent context switch will not reuse the
stale CPU state, and will instead set TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE, forcing the
new state to be reloaded from memory prior to a return to userspace.",'-,7,961539,Rocky Linux Security Update for kernel (RLSA-2025:1068),4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 18, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,132181680,ptdtc-sv-iris06.portugal.pt,10.200.8.203,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:c867,Refer to Rocky Linux security advisory RLSA-2025:1068 for updates and patch information.(https://errata.rockylinux.org/RLSA-2025:1068),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT,Group-4",No,No,35,12,"Feb 17, 2025","Feb 13, 2025",Rocky Linux,HIGH,High Lateral Movement,Rocky Linux 8.10,'-,'-,74,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability.",No,2,341,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-8508,"NLnet Labs Unbound up to and including version 1.21.0 contains a vulnerability when handling replies with very large RRsets that it needs to perform name compression for. Malicious upstreams responses with very large RRsets can cause Unbound to spend a considerable time applying name compression to downstream replies. This can lead to degraded performance and eventually denial of service in well orchestrated attacks. The vulnerability can be exploited by a malicious actor querying Unbound for the specially crafted contents of a malicious zone with very large RRsets. Before Unbound replies to the query it will try to apply name compression which was an unbounded operation that could lock the CPU until the whole packet was complete. Unbound version 1.21.1 introduces a hard limit on the number of name compression calculations it is willing to do per packet. Packets that need more compression will result in semi-compressed packets or truncated packets, even on TCP for huge messages, to avoid locking the CPU for long.

CVE-2024-26935,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: core: Fix unremoved procfs host directory regression

Commit fc663711b944 (""scsi: core: Remove the /proc/scsi/${proc_name}
directory earlier"") fixed a bug related to modules loading/unloading, by
adding a call to scsi_proc_hostdir_rm() on scsi_remove_host(). But that led
to a potential duplicate call to the hostdir_rm() routine, since it's also
called from scsi_host_dev_release(). That triggered a regression report,
which was then fixed by commit be03df3d4bfe (""scsi: core: Fix a procfs host
directory removal regression""). The fix just dropped the hostdir_rm() call
from dev_release().

But it happens that this proc directory is created on scsi_host_alloc(),
and that function ""pairs"" with scsi_host_dev_release(), while
scsi_remove_host() pairs with scsi_add_host(). In other words, it seems the
reason for removing the proc directory on dev_release() was meant to cover
cases in which a SCSI host structure was allocated, but the call to
scsi_add_host() didn't happen. And that pattern happens to exist in some
error paths, for example.

Syzkaller causes that by using USB raw gadget device, error'ing on
usb-storage driver, at usb_stor_probe2(). By checking that path, we can see
that the BadDevice label leads to a scsi_host_put() after a SCSI host
allocation, but there's no call to scsi_add_host() in such path. That leads
to messages like this in dmesg (and a leak of the SCSI host proc
structure):

usb-storage 4-1:87.51: USB Mass Storage device detected

WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 3519 at fs/proc/generic.c:377 proc_register+0x347/0x4e0 fs/proc/generic.c:376

The proper fix seems to still call scsi_proc_hostdir_rm() on dev_release(),
but guard that with the state check for SHOST_CREATED; there is even a
comment in scsi_host_dev_release() detailing that: such conditional is
meant for cases where the SCSI host was allocated but there was no calls to
{add,remove}_host(), like the usb-storage case.

This is what we propose here and with that, the error path of usb-storage
does not trigger the warning anymore.",'-,'-,961539,Rocky Linux Security Update for kernel (RLSA-2025:1068),4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 18, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,132177718,ptdtc-sv-iris02.portugal.pt,"10.200.6.200,10.200.6.202",fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:a67,Refer to Rocky Linux security advisory RLSA-2025:1068 for updates and patch information.(https://errata.rockylinux.org/RLSA-2025:1068),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT,Group-8",No,No,'-,12,"Feb 17, 2025","Feb 13, 2025",Rocky Linux,HIGH,High Lateral Movement,Rocky Linux 8.10,'-,'-,70,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability.",No,2,343,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-50275,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64/sve: Discard stale CPU state when handling SVE traps

The logic for handling SVE traps manipulates saved FPSIMD/SVE state
incorrectly, and a race with preemption can result in a task having
TIF_SVE set and TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE clear even though the live CPU state
is stale (e.g. with SVE traps enabled). This has been observed to result
in warnings from do_sve_acc() where SVE traps are not expected while
TIF_SVE is set:

|         if (test_and_set_thread_flag(TIF_SVE))
|                 WARN_ON(1); /* SVE access shouldn't have trapped */

Warnings of this form have been reported intermittently, e.g.

  https://lore.kernel.org/linux-arm-kernel/CA+G9fYtEGe_DhY2Ms7+L7NKsLYUomGsgqpdBj+QwDLeSg=JhGg@mail.gmail.com/
  https://lore.kernel.org/linux-arm-kernel/000000000000511e9a060ce5a45c@google.com/

The race can occur when the SVE trap handler is preempted before and
after manipulating the saved FPSIMD/SVE state, starting and ending on
the same CPU, e.g.

| void do_sve_acc(unsigned long esr, struct pt_regs *regs)
| {
|         // Trap on CPU 0 with TIF_SVE clear, SVE traps enabled
|         // task->fpsimd_cpu is 0.
|         // per_cpu_ptr(&fpsimd_last_state, 0) is task.
|
|         ...
|
|         // Preempted; migrated from CPU 0 to CPU 1.
|         // TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is set.
|
|         get_cpu_fpsimd_context();
|
|         if (test_and_set_thread_flag(TIF_SVE))
|                 WARN_ON(1); /* SVE access shouldn't have trapped */
|
|         sve_init_regs() {
|                 if (!test_thread_flag(TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE)) {
|                         ...
|                 } else {
|                         fpsimd_to_sve(current);
|                         current->thread.fp_type = FP_STATE_SVE;
|                 }
|         }
|
|         put_cpu_fpsimd_context();
|
|         // Preempted; migrated from CPU 1 to CPU 0.
|         // task->fpsimd_cpu is still 0
|         // If per_cpu_ptr(&fpsimd_last_state, 0) is still task then:
|         // - Stale HW state is reused (with SVE traps enabled)
|         // - TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is cleared
|         // - A return to userspace skips HW state restore
| }

Fix the case where the state is not live and TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is set
by calling fpsimd_flush_task_state() to detach from the saved CPU
state. This ensures that a subsequent context switch will not reuse the
stale CPU state, and will instead set TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE, forcing the
new state to be reloaded from memory prior to a return to userspace.",'-,7,961539,Rocky Linux Security Update for kernel (RLSA-2025:1068),4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 18, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,132177718,ptdtc-sv-iris02.portugal.pt,"10.200.6.200,10.200.6.202",fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:a67,Refer to Rocky Linux security advisory RLSA-2025:1068 for updates and patch information.(https://errata.rockylinux.org/RLSA-2025:1068),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT,Group-8",No,No,35,12,"Feb 17, 2025","Feb 13, 2025",Rocky Linux,HIGH,High Lateral Movement,Rocky Linux 8.10,'-,'-,70,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability.",No,2,343,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-50275,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64/sve: Discard stale CPU state when handling SVE traps

The logic for handling SVE traps manipulates saved FPSIMD/SVE state
incorrectly, and a race with preemption can result in a task having
TIF_SVE set and TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE clear even though the live CPU state
is stale (e.g. with SVE traps enabled). This has been observed to result
in warnings from do_sve_acc() where SVE traps are not expected while
TIF_SVE is set:

|         if (test_and_set_thread_flag(TIF_SVE))
|                 WARN_ON(1); /* SVE access shouldn't have trapped */

Warnings of this form have been reported intermittently, e.g.

  https://lore.kernel.org/linux-arm-kernel/CA+G9fYtEGe_DhY2Ms7+L7NKsLYUomGsgqpdBj+QwDLeSg=JhGg@mail.gmail.com/
  https://lore.kernel.org/linux-arm-kernel/000000000000511e9a060ce5a45c@google.com/

The race can occur when the SVE trap handler is preempted before and
after manipulating the saved FPSIMD/SVE state, starting and ending on
the same CPU, e.g.

| void do_sve_acc(unsigned long esr, struct pt_regs *regs)
| {
|         // Trap on CPU 0 with TIF_SVE clear, SVE traps enabled
|         // task->fpsimd_cpu is 0.
|         // per_cpu_ptr(&fpsimd_last_state, 0) is task.
|
|         ...
|
|         // Preempted; migrated from CPU 0 to CPU 1.
|         // TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is set.
|
|         get_cpu_fpsimd_context();
|
|         if (test_and_set_thread_flag(TIF_SVE))
|                 WARN_ON(1); /* SVE access shouldn't have trapped */
|
|         sve_init_regs() {
|                 if (!test_thread_flag(TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE)) {
|                         ...
|                 } else {
|                         fpsimd_to_sve(current);
|                         current->thread.fp_type = FP_STATE_SVE;
|                 }
|         }
|
|         put_cpu_fpsimd_context();
|
|         // Preempted; migrated from CPU 1 to CPU 0.
|         // task->fpsimd_cpu is still 0
|         // If per_cpu_ptr(&fpsimd_last_state, 0) is still task then:
|         // - Stale HW state is reused (with SVE traps enabled)
|         // - TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is cleared
|         // - A return to userspace skips HW state restore
| }

Fix the case where the state is not live and TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is set
by calling fpsimd_flush_task_state() to detach from the saved CPU
state. This ensures that a subsequent context switch will not reuse the
stale CPU state, and will instead set TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE, forcing the
new state to be reloaded from memory prior to a return to userspace.",'-,7,961539,Rocky Linux Security Update for kernel (RLSA-2025:1068),4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 18, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,132185388,ptprt-389-node1.portugal.pt,10.200.8.31,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:2f9d,Refer to Rocky Linux security advisory RLSA-2025:1068 for updates and patch information.(https://errata.rockylinux.org/RLSA-2025:1068),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,SO:Rocky,Linux-PT,Group-6",No,No,35,12,"Feb 17, 2025","Feb 13, 2025",Rocky Linux,HIGH,High Lateral Movement,Rocky Linux 8.10,'-,'-,67,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability.",No,2,257,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-26935,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: core: Fix unremoved procfs host directory regression

Commit fc663711b944 (""scsi: core: Remove the /proc/scsi/${proc_name}
directory earlier"") fixed a bug related to modules loading/unloading, by
adding a call to scsi_proc_hostdir_rm() on scsi_remove_host(). But that led
to a potential duplicate call to the hostdir_rm() routine, since it's also
called from scsi_host_dev_release(). That triggered a regression report,
which was then fixed by commit be03df3d4bfe (""scsi: core: Fix a procfs host
directory removal regression""). The fix just dropped the hostdir_rm() call
from dev_release().

But it happens that this proc directory is created on scsi_host_alloc(),
and that function ""pairs"" with scsi_host_dev_release(), while
scsi_remove_host() pairs with scsi_add_host(). In other words, it seems the
reason for removing the proc directory on dev_release() was meant to cover
cases in which a SCSI host structure was allocated, but the call to
scsi_add_host() didn't happen. And that pattern happens to exist in some
error paths, for example.

Syzkaller causes that by using USB raw gadget device, error'ing on
usb-storage driver, at usb_stor_probe2(). By checking that path, we can see
that the BadDevice label leads to a scsi_host_put() after a SCSI host
allocation, but there's no call to scsi_add_host() in such path. That leads
to messages like this in dmesg (and a leak of the SCSI host proc
structure):

CVE-2024-8508,"NLnet Labs Unbound up to and including version 1.21.0 contains a vulnerability when handling replies with very large RRsets that it needs to perform name compression for. Malicious upstreams responses with very large RRsets can cause Unbound to spend a considerable time applying name compression to downstream replies. This can lead to degraded performance and eventually denial of service in well orchestrated attacks. The vulnerability can be exploited by a malicious actor querying Unbound for the specially crafted contents of a malicious zone with very large RRsets. Before Unbound replies to the query it will try to apply name compression which was an unbounded operation that could lock the CPU until the whole packet was complete. Unbound version 1.21.1 introduces a hard limit on the number of name compression calculations it is willing to do per packet. Packets that need more compression will result in semi-compressed packets or truncated packets, even on TCP for huge messages, to avoid locking the CPU for long.

CVE-2024-26935,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: core: Fix unremoved procfs host directory regression

Commit fc663711b944 (""scsi: core: Remove the /proc/scsi/${proc_name}
directory earlier"") fixed a bug related to modules loading/unloading, by
adding a call to scsi_proc_hostdir_rm() on scsi_remove_host(). But that led
to a potential duplicate call to the hostdir_rm() routine, since it's also
called from scsi_host_dev_release(). That triggered a regression report,
which was then fixed by commit be03df3d4bfe (""scsi: core: Fix a procfs host
directory removal regression""). The fix just dropped the hostdir_rm() call
from dev_release().

But it happens that this proc directory is created on scsi_host_alloc(),
and that function ""pairs"" with scsi_host_dev_release(), while
scsi_remove_host() pairs with scsi_add_host(). In other words, it seems the
reason for removing the proc directory on dev_release() was meant to cover
cases in which a SCSI host structure was allocated, but the call to
scsi_add_host() didn't happen. And that pattern happens to exist in some
error paths, for example.

Syzkaller causes that by using USB raw gadget device, error'ing on
usb-storage driver, at usb_stor_probe2(). By checking that path, we can see
that the BadDevice label leads to a scsi_host_put() after a SCSI host
allocation, but there's no call to scsi_add_host() in such path. That leads
to messages like this in dmesg (and a leak of the SCSI host proc
structure):

usb-storage 4-1:87.51: USB Mass Storage device detected
proc_dir_entry 'scsi/usb-storage' already registered
WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 3519 at fs/proc/generic.c:377 proc_register+0x347/0x4e0 fs/proc/generic.c:376

The proper fix seems to still call scsi_proc_hostdir_rm() on dev_release(),
but guard that with the state check for SHOST_CREATED; there is even a
comment in scsi_host_dev_release() detailing that: such conditional is
meant for cases where the SCSI host was allocated but there was no calls to
{add,remove}_host(), like the usb-storage case.

This is what we propose here and with that, the error path of usb-storage
does not trigger the warning anymore.",'-,'-,961539,Rocky Linux Security Update for kernel (RLSA-2025:1068),4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 19, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,132177878,ptdtc-sv-iris01.portugal.pt,10.200.6.201,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:e9d7,Refer to Rocky Linux security advisory RLSA-2025:1068 for updates and patch information.(https://errata.rockylinux.org/RLSA-2025:1068),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT,Group-7",No,No,'-,12,"Feb 17, 2025","Feb 13, 2025",Rocky Linux,HIGH,High Lateral Movement,Rocky Linux 8.10,'-,'-,68,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability.",No,2,343,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-50275,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64/sve: Discard stale CPU state when handling SVE traps

The logic for handling SVE traps manipulates saved FPSIMD/SVE state
incorrectly, and a race with preemption can result in a task having
TIF_SVE set and TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE clear even though the live CPU state
is stale (e.g. with SVE traps enabled). This has been observed to result
in warnings from do_sve_acc() where SVE traps are not expected while
TIF_SVE is set:

|         if (test_and_set_thread_flag(TIF_SVE))
|                 WARN_ON(1); /* SVE access shouldn't have trapped */

Warnings of this form have been reported intermittently, e.g.

  https://lore.kernel.org/linux-arm-kernel/CA+G9fYtEGe_DhY2Ms7+L7NKsLYUomGsgqpdBj+QwDLeSg=JhGg@mail.gmail.com/
  https://lore.kernel.org/linux-arm-kernel/000000000000511e9a060ce5a45c@google.com/

The race can occur when the SVE trap handler is preempted before and
after manipulating the saved FPSIMD/SVE state, starting and ending on
the same CPU, e.g.

| void do_sve_acc(unsigned long esr, struct pt_regs *regs)
| {
|         // Trap on CPU 0 with TIF_SVE clear, SVE traps enabled
|         // task->fpsimd_cpu is 0.
|         // per_cpu_ptr(&fpsimd_last_state, 0) is task.
|
|         ...
|
|         // Preempted; migrated from CPU 0 to CPU 1.
|         // TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is set.
|
|         get_cpu_fpsimd_context();
|
|         if (test_and_set_thread_flag(TIF_SVE))
|                 WARN_ON(1); /* SVE access shouldn't have trapped */
|
|         sve_init_regs() {
|                 if (!test_thread_flag(TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE)) {
|                         ...
|                 } else {
|                         fpsimd_to_sve(current);
|                         current->thread.fp_type = FP_STATE_SVE;
|                 }
|         }
|
|         put_cpu_fpsimd_context();
|
|         // Preempted; migrated from CPU 1 to CPU 0.
|         // task->fpsimd_cpu is still 0
|         // If per_cpu_ptr(&fpsimd_last_state, 0) is still task then:
|         // - Stale HW state is reused (with SVE traps enabled)
|         // - TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is cleared
|         // - A return to userspace skips HW state restore
| }

Fix the case where the state is not live and TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is set
by calling fpsimd_flush_task_state() to detach from the saved CPU
state. This ensures that a subsequent context switch will not reuse the
stale CPU state, and will instead set TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE, forcing the
new state to be reloaded from memory prior to a return to userspace.",'-,7,961539,Rocky Linux Security Update for kernel (RLSA-2025:1068),4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 19, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,132177878,ptdtc-sv-iris01.portugal.pt,10.200.6.201,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:e9d7,Refer to Rocky Linux security advisory RLSA-2025:1068 for updates and patch information.(https://errata.rockylinux.org/RLSA-2025:1068),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT,Group-7",No,No,35,12,"Feb 17, 2025","Feb 13, 2025",Rocky Linux,HIGH,High Lateral Movement,Rocky Linux 8.10,'-,'-,68,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability.",No,2,343,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-26935,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: core: Fix unremoved procfs host directory regression

Commit fc663711b944 (""scsi: core: Remove the /proc/scsi/${proc_name}
directory earlier"") fixed a bug related to modules loading/unloading, by
adding a call to scsi_proc_hostdir_rm() on scsi_remove_host(). But that led
to a potential duplicate call to the hostdir_rm() routine, since it's also
called from scsi_host_dev_release(). That triggered a regression report,
which was then fixed by commit be03df3d4bfe (""scsi: core: Fix a procfs host
directory removal regression""). The fix just dropped the hostdir_rm() call
from dev_release().

But it happens that this proc directory is created on scsi_host_alloc(),
and that function ""pairs"" with scsi_host_dev_release(), while
scsi_remove_host() pairs with scsi_add_host(). In other words, it seems the
reason for removing the proc directory on dev_release() was meant to cover
cases in which a SCSI host structure was allocated, but the call to
scsi_add_host() didn't happen. And that pattern happens to exist in some
error paths, for example.

Syzkaller causes that by using USB raw gadget device, error'ing on
usb-storage driver, at usb_stor_probe2(). By checking that path, we can see
that the BadDevice label leads to a scsi_host_put() after a SCSI host
allocation, but there's no call to scsi_add_host() in such path. That leads
to messages like this in dmesg (and a leak of the SCSI host proc
structure):

usb-storage 4-1:87.51: USB Mass Storage device detected
proc_dir_entry 'scsi/usb-storage' already registered
WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 3519 at fs/proc/generic.c:377 proc_register+0x347/0x4e0 fs/proc/generic.c:376

The proper fix seems to still call scsi_proc_hostdir_rm() on dev_release(),
but guard that with the state check for SHOST_CREATED; there is even a
comment in scsi_host_dev_release() detailing that: such conditional is
meant for cases where the SCSI host was allocated but there was no calls to
{add,remove}_host(), like the usb-storage case.

This is what we propose here and with that, the error path of usb-storage
does not trigger the warning anymore.",'-,'-,961539,Rocky Linux Security Update for kernel (RLSA-2025:1068),4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 18, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,132181993,ptdtc-sv-iris08.portugal.pt,10.200.8.205,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:376b,Refer to Rocky Linux security advisory RLSA-2025:1068 for updates and patch information.(https://errata.rockylinux.org/RLSA-2025:1068),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT,Group-4",No,No,'-,12,"Feb 17, 2025","Feb 13, 2025",Rocky Linux,HIGH,High Lateral Movement,Rocky Linux 8.10,'-,'-,74,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability.",No,2,344,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-50275,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64/sve: Discard stale CPU state when handling SVE traps

The logic for handling SVE traps manipulates saved FPSIMD/SVE state
incorrectly, and a race with preemption can result in a task having
TIF_SVE set and TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE clear even though the live CPU state
is stale (e.g. with SVE traps enabled). This has been observed to result
in warnings from do_sve_acc() where SVE traps are not expected while
TIF_SVE is set:

|         if (test_and_set_thread_flag(TIF_SVE))
|                 WARN_ON(1); /* SVE access shouldn't have trapped */

Warnings of this form have been reported intermittently, e.g.

  https://lore.kernel.org/linux-arm-kernel/CA+G9fYtEGe_DhY2Ms7+L7NKsLYUomGsgqpdBj+QwDLeSg=JhGg@mail.gmail.com/
  https://lore.kernel.org/linux-arm-kernel/000000000000511e9a060ce5a45c@google.com/

The race can occur when the SVE trap handler is preempted before and
after manipulating the saved FPSIMD/SVE state, starting and ending on
the same CPU, e.g.

| void do_sve_acc(unsigned long esr, struct pt_regs *regs)
| {
|         // Trap on CPU 0 with TIF_SVE clear, SVE traps enabled
|         // task->fpsimd_cpu is 0.
|         // per_cpu_ptr(&fpsimd_last_state, 0) is task.
|
|         ...
|
|         // Preempted; migrated from CPU 0 to CPU 1.
|         // TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is set.
|
|         get_cpu_fpsimd_context();
|
|         if (test_and_set_thread_flag(TIF_SVE))
|                 WARN_ON(1); /* SVE access shouldn't have trapped */
|
|         sve_init_regs() {
|                 if (!test_thread_flag(TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE)) {
|                         ...
|                 } else {
|                         fpsimd_to_sve(current);
|                         current->thread.fp_type = FP_STATE_SVE;
|                 }
|         }
|
|         put_cpu_fpsimd_context();
|
|         // Preempted; migrated from CPU 1 to CPU 0.
|         // task->fpsimd_cpu is still 0
|         // If per_cpu_ptr(&fpsimd_last_state, 0) is still task then:
|         // - Stale HW state is reused (with SVE traps enabled)
|         // - TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is cleared
|         // - A return to userspace skips HW state restore
| }

Fix the case where the state is not live and TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is set
by calling fpsimd_flush_task_state() to detach from the saved CPU
state. This ensures that a subsequent context switch will not reuse the
stale CPU state, and will instead set TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE, forcing the
new state to be reloaded from memory prior to a return to userspace.",'-,7,961539,Rocky Linux Security Update for kernel (RLSA-2025:1068),4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 18, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,132181993,ptdtc-sv-iris08.portugal.pt,10.200.8.205,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:376b,Refer to Rocky Linux security advisory RLSA-2025:1068 for updates and patch information.(https://errata.rockylinux.org/RLSA-2025:1068),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT,Group-4",No,No,35,12,"Feb 17, 2025","Feb 13, 2025",Rocky Linux,HIGH,High Lateral Movement,Rocky Linux 8.10,'-,'-,74,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability.",No,2,344,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-8508,"NLnet Labs Unbound up to and including version 1.21.0 contains a vulnerability when handling replies with very large RRsets that it needs to perform name compression for. Malicious upstreams responses with very large RRsets can cause Unbound to spend a considerable time applying name compression to downstream replies. This can lead to degraded performance and eventually denial of service in well orchestrated attacks. The vulnerability can be exploited by a malicious actor querying Unbound for the specially crafted contents of a malicious zone with very large RRsets. Before Unbound replies to the query it will try to apply name compression which was an unbounded operation that could lock the CPU until the whole packet was complete. Unbound version 1.21.1 introduces a hard limit on the number of name compression calculations it is willing to do per packet. Packets that need more compression will result in semi-compressed packets or truncated packets, even on TCP for huge messages, to avoid locking the CPU for long.

CVE-2024-26935,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: core: Fix unremoved procfs host directory regression

Commit fc663711b944 (""scsi: core: Remove the /proc/scsi/${proc_name}
directory earlier"") fixed a bug related to modules loading/unloading, by
adding a call to scsi_proc_hostdir_rm() on scsi_remove_host(). But that led
to a potential duplicate call to the hostdir_rm() routine, since it's also
called from scsi_host_dev_release(). That triggered a regression report,
which was then fixed by commit be03df3d4bfe (""scsi: core: Fix a procfs host
directory removal regression""). The fix just dropped the hostdir_rm() call
from dev_release().

But it happens that this proc directory is created on scsi_host_alloc(),
and that function ""pairs"" with scsi_host_dev_release(), while
scsi_remove_host() pairs with scsi_add_host(). In other words, it seems the
reason for removing the proc directory on dev_release() was meant to cover
cases in which a SCSI host structure was allocated, but the call to
scsi_add_host() didn't happen. And that pattern happens to exist in some
error paths, for example.

Syzkaller causes that by using USB raw gadget device, error'ing on
usb-storage driver, at usb_stor_probe2(). By checking that path, we can see
that the BadDevice label leads to a scsi_host_put() after a SCSI host
allocation, but there's no call to scsi_add_host() in such path. That leads
to messages like this in dmesg (and a leak of the SCSI host proc
structure):

usb-storage 4-1:87.51: USB Mass Storage device detected
proc_dir_entry 'scsi/usb-storage' already registered
WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 3519 at fs/proc/generic.c:377 proc_register+0x347/0x4e0 fs/proc/generic.c:376

The proper fix seems to still call scsi_proc_hostdir_rm() on dev_release(),
but guard that with the state check for SHOST_CREATED; there is even a
comment in scsi_host_dev_release() detailing that: such conditional is
meant for cases where the SCSI host was allocated but there was no calls to
{add,remove}_host(), like the usb-storage case.

This is what we propose here and with that, the error path of usb-storage
does not trigger the warning anymore.",'-,'-,961539,Rocky Linux Security Update for kernel (RLSA-2025:1068),4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 18, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,132177753,ptdtc-sv-iris05.portugal.pt,10.200.8.202,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:bc27,Refer to Rocky Linux security advisory RLSA-2025:1068 for updates and patch information.(https://errata.rockylinux.org/RLSA-2025:1068),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT,Group-5",No,No,'-,12,"Feb 17, 2025","Feb 13, 2025",Rocky Linux,HIGH,High Lateral Movement,Rocky Linux 8.10,'-,'-,68,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability.",No,2,343,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-50275,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64/sve: Discard stale CPU state when handling SVE traps

The logic for handling SVE traps manipulates saved FPSIMD/SVE state
incorrectly, and a race with preemption can result in a task having
TIF_SVE set and TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE clear even though the live CPU state
is stale (e.g. with SVE traps enabled). This has been observed to result
in warnings from do_sve_acc() where SVE traps are not expected while
TIF_SVE is set:

|         if (test_and_set_thread_flag(TIF_SVE))
|                 WARN_ON(1); /* SVE access shouldn't have trapped */

Warnings of this form have been reported intermittently, e.g.

  https://lore.kernel.org/linux-arm-kernel/CA+G9fYtEGe_DhY2Ms7+L7NKsLYUomGsgqpdBj+QwDLeSg=JhGg@mail.gmail.com/
  https://lore.kernel.org/linux-arm-kernel/000000000000511e9a060ce5a45c@google.com/

The race can occur when the SVE trap handler is preempted before and
after manipulating the saved FPSIMD/SVE state, starting and ending on
the same CPU, e.g.

| void do_sve_acc(unsigned long esr, struct pt_regs *regs)
| {
|         // Trap on CPU 0 with TIF_SVE clear, SVE traps enabled
|         // task->fpsimd_cpu is 0.
|         // per_cpu_ptr(&fpsimd_last_state, 0) is task.
|
|         ...
|
|         // Preempted; migrated from CPU 0 to CPU 1.
|         // TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is set.
|
|         get_cpu_fpsimd_context();
|
|         if (test_and_set_thread_flag(TIF_SVE))
|                 WARN_ON(1); /* SVE access shouldn't have trapped */
|
|         sve_init_regs() {
|                 if (!test_thread_flag(TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE)) {
|                         ...
|                 } else {
|                         fpsimd_to_sve(current);
|                         current->thread.fp_type = FP_STATE_SVE;
|                 }
|         }
|
|         put_cpu_fpsimd_context();
|
|         // Preempted; migrated from CPU 1 to CPU 0.
|         // task->fpsimd_cpu is still 0
|         // If per_cpu_ptr(&fpsimd_last_state, 0) is still task then:
|         // - Stale HW state is reused (with SVE traps enabled)
|         // - TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is cleared
|         // - A return to userspace skips HW state restore
| }

Fix the case where the state is not live and TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is set
by calling fpsimd_flush_task_state() to detach from the saved CPU
state. This ensures that a subsequent context switch will not reuse the
stale CPU state, and will instead set TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE, forcing the
new state to be reloaded from memory prior to a return to userspace.",'-,7,961539,Rocky Linux Security Update for kernel (RLSA-2025:1068),4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 18, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,132177753,ptdtc-sv-iris05.portugal.pt,10.200.8.202,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:bc27,Refer to Rocky Linux security advisory RLSA-2025:1068 for updates and patch information.(https://errata.rockylinux.org/RLSA-2025:1068),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT,Group-5",No,No,35,12,"Feb 17, 2025","Feb 13, 2025",Rocky Linux,HIGH,High Lateral Movement,Rocky Linux 8.10,'-,'-,68,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability.",No,2,343,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-8508,"NLnet Labs Unbound up to and including version 1.21.0 contains a vulnerability when handling replies with very large RRsets that it needs to perform name compression for. Malicious upstreams responses with very large RRsets can cause Unbound to spend a considerable time applying name compression to downstream replies. This can lead to degraded performance and eventually denial of service in well orchestrated attacks. The vulnerability can be exploited by a malicious actor querying Unbound for the specially crafted contents of a malicious zone with very large RRsets. Before Unbound replies to the query it will try to apply name compression which was an unbounded operation that could lock the CPU until the whole packet was complete. Unbound version 1.21.1 introduces a hard limit on the number of name compression calculations it is willing to do per packet. Packets that need more compression will result in semi-compressed packets or truncated packets, even on TCP for huge messages, to avoid locking the CPU for long.

CVE-2024-26935,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: core: Fix unremoved procfs host directory regression

Commit fc663711b944 (""scsi: core: Remove the /proc/scsi/${proc_name}
directory earlier"") fixed a bug related to modules loading/unloading, by
adding a call to scsi_proc_hostdir_rm() on scsi_remove_host(). But that led
to a potential duplicate call to the hostdir_rm() routine, since it's also
called from scsi_host_dev_release(). That triggered a regression report,
which was then fixed by commit be03df3d4bfe (""scsi: core: Fix a procfs host
directory removal regression""). The fix just dropped the hostdir_rm() call
from dev_release().

But it happens that this proc directory is created on scsi_host_alloc(),
and that function ""pairs"" with scsi_host_dev_release(), while
scsi_remove_host() pairs with scsi_add_host(). In other words, it seems the
reason for removing the proc directory on dev_release() was meant to cover
cases in which a SCSI host structure was allocated, but the call to
scsi_add_host() didn't happen. And that pattern happens to exist in some
error paths, for example.

Syzkaller causes that by using USB raw gadget device, error'ing on
usb-storage driver, at usb_stor_probe2(). By checking that path, we can see
that the BadDevice label leads to a scsi_host_put() after a SCSI host
allocation, but there's no call to scsi_add_host() in such path. That leads
to messages like this in dmesg (and a leak of the SCSI host proc
structure):

usb-storage 4-1:87.51: USB Mass Storage device detected
proc_dir_entry 'scsi/usb-storage' already registered
WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 3519 at fs/proc/generic.c:377 proc_register+0x347/0x4e0 fs/proc/generic.c:376

The proper fix seems to still call scsi_proc_hostdir_rm() on dev_release(),
but guard that with the state check for SHOST_CREATED; there is even a
comment in scsi_host_dev_release() detailing that: such conditional is
meant for cases where the SCSI host was allocated but there was no calls to
{add,remove}_host(), like the usb-storage case.

This is what we propose here and with that, the error path of usb-storage
does not trigger the warning anymore.",'-,'-,961539,Rocky Linux Security Update for kernel (RLSA-2025:1068),4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 18, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,208883419,ptdtc-sv-iris03.portugal.pt,10.200.6.203,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:198f,Refer to Rocky Linux security advisory RLSA-2025:1068 for updates and patch information.(https://errata.rockylinux.org/RLSA-2025:1068),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,'-,12,"Feb 17, 2025","Feb 13, 2025",Rocky Linux,HIGH,High Lateral Movement,Rocky Linux 8.10,'-,'-,71,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability.",No,2,343,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-50275,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64/sve: Discard stale CPU state when handling SVE traps

The logic for handling SVE traps manipulates saved FPSIMD/SVE state
incorrectly, and a race with preemption can result in a task having
TIF_SVE set and TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE clear even though the live CPU state
is stale (e.g. with SVE traps enabled). This has been observed to result
in warnings from do_sve_acc() where SVE traps are not expected while
TIF_SVE is set:

|         if (test_and_set_thread_flag(TIF_SVE))
|                 WARN_ON(1); /* SVE access shouldn't have trapped */

Warnings of this form have been reported intermittently, e.g.

  https://lore.kernel.org/linux-arm-kernel/CA+G9fYtEGe_DhY2Ms7+L7NKsLYUomGsgqpdBj+QwDLeSg=JhGg@mail.gmail.com/
  https://lore.kernel.org/linux-arm-kernel/000000000000511e9a060ce5a45c@google.com/

The race can occur when the SVE trap handler is preempted before and
after manipulating the saved FPSIMD/SVE state, starting and ending on
the same CPU, e.g.

| void do_sve_acc(unsigned long esr, struct pt_regs *regs)
| {
|         // Trap on CPU 0 with TIF_SVE clear, SVE traps enabled
|         // task->fpsimd_cpu is 0.
|         // per_cpu_ptr(&fpsimd_last_state, 0) is task.
|
|         ...
|
|         // Preempted; migrated from CPU 0 to CPU 1.
|         // TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is set.
|
|         get_cpu_fpsimd_context();
|
|         if (test_and_set_thread_flag(TIF_SVE))
|                 WARN_ON(1); /* SVE access shouldn't have trapped */
|
|         sve_init_regs() {
|                 if (!test_thread_flag(TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE)) {
|                         ...
|                 } else {
|                         fpsimd_to_sve(current);
|                         current->thread.fp_type = FP_STATE_SVE;
|                 }
|         }
|
|         put_cpu_fpsimd_context();
|
|         // Preempted; migrated from CPU 1 to CPU 0.
|         // task->fpsimd_cpu is still 0
|         // If per_cpu_ptr(&fpsimd_last_state, 0) is still task then:
|         // - Stale HW state is reused (with SVE traps enabled)
|         // - TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is cleared
|         // - A return to userspace skips HW state restore
| }

Fix the case where the state is not live and TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is set
by calling fpsimd_flush_task_state() to detach from the saved CPU
state. This ensures that a subsequent context switch will not reuse the
stale CPU state, and will instead set TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE, forcing the
new state to be reloaded from memory prior to a return to userspace.",'-,7,961539,Rocky Linux Security Update for kernel (RLSA-2025:1068),4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 18, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,208883419,ptdtc-sv-iris03.portugal.pt,10.200.6.203,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:198f,Refer to Rocky Linux security advisory RLSA-2025:1068 for updates and patch information.(https://errata.rockylinux.org/RLSA-2025:1068),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,35,12,"Feb 17, 2025","Feb 13, 2025",Rocky Linux,HIGH,High Lateral Movement,Rocky Linux 8.10,'-,'-,71,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability.",No,2,343,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-8508,"NLnet Labs Unbound up to and including version 1.21.0 contains a vulnerability when handling replies with very large RRsets that it needs to perform name compression for. Malicious upstreams responses with very large RRsets can cause Unbound to spend a considerable time applying name compression to downstream replies. This can lead to degraded performance and eventually denial of service in well orchestrated attacks. The vulnerability can be exploited by a malicious actor querying Unbound for the specially crafted contents of a malicious zone with very large RRsets. Before Unbound replies to the query it will try to apply name compression which was an unbounded operation that could lock the CPU until the whole packet was complete. Unbound version 1.21.1 introduces a hard limit on the number of name compression calculations it is willing to do per packet.

CVE-2024-26935,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: core: Fix unremoved procfs host directory regression

Commit fc663711b944 (""scsi: core: Remove the /proc/scsi/${proc_name}
directory earlier"") fixed a bug related to modules loading/unloading, by
adding a call to scsi_proc_hostdir_rm() on scsi_remove_host(). But that led
to a potential duplicate call to the hostdir_rm() routine, since it's also
called from scsi_host_dev_release(). That triggered a regression report,
which was then fixed by commit be03df3d4bfe (""scsi: core: Fix a procfs host
directory removal regression""). The fix just dropped the hostdir_rm() call
from dev_release().

But it happens that this proc directory is created on scsi_host_alloc(),
and that function ""pairs"" with scsi_host_dev_release(), while
scsi_remove_host() pairs with scsi_add_host(). In other words, it seems the
reason for removing the proc directory on dev_release() was meant to cover
cases in which a SCSI host structure was allocated, but the call to
scsi_add_host() didn't happen. And that pattern happens to exist in some
error paths, for example.

Syzkaller causes that by using USB raw gadget device, error'ing on
usb-storage driver, at usb_stor_probe2(). By checking that path, we can see
that the BadDevice label leads to a scsi_host_put() after a SCSI host
allocation, but there's no call to scsi_add_host() in such path. That leads
to messages like this in dmesg (and a leak of the SCSI host proc
structure):

usb-storage 4-1:87.51: USB Mass Storage device detected
proc_dir_entry 'scsi/usb-storage' already registered
WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 3519 at fs/proc/generic.c:377 proc_register+0x347/0x4e0 fs/proc/generic.c:376

The proper fix seems to still call scsi_proc_hostdir_rm() on dev_release(),
but guard that with the state check for SHOST_CREATED; there is even a
comment in scsi_host_dev_release() detailing that: such conditional is
meant for cases where the SCSI host was allocated but there was no calls to
{add,remove}_host(), like the usb-storage case.

This is what we propose here and with that, the error path of usb-storage
does not trigger the warning anymore.",'-,'-,961539,Rocky Linux Security Update for kernel (RLSA-2025:1068),4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 18, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,132185706,ptdtc-sv-ftp.portugal.pt,10.208.230.247,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:cf71,Refer to Rocky Linux security advisory RLSA-2025:1068 for updates and patch information.(https://errata.rockylinux.org/RLSA-2025:1068),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,SO:Rocky,Linux-PT,Group-8",No,No,'-,12,"Feb 17, 2025","Feb 13, 2025",Rocky Linux,HIGH,High Lateral Movement,Rocky Linux 8.10,'-,'-,66,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability.",No,2,255,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-50275,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64/sve: Discard stale CPU state when handling SVE traps

The logic for handling SVE traps manipulates saved FPSIMD/SVE state
incorrectly, and a race with preemption can result in a task having
TIF_SVE set and TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE clear even though the live CPU state
is stale (e.g. with SVE traps enabled). This has been observed to result
in warnings from do_sve_acc() where SVE traps are not expected while
TIF_SVE is set:

|         if (test_and_set_thread_flag(TIF_SVE))
|                 WARN_ON(1); /* SVE access shouldn't have trapped */

Warnings of this form have been reported intermittently, e.g.

  https://lore.kernel.org/linux-arm-kernel/CA+G9fYtEGe_DhY2Ms7+L7NKsLYUomGsgqpdBj+QwDLeSg=JhGg@mail.gmail.com/
  https://lore.kernel.org/linux-arm-kernel/000000000000511e9a060ce5a45c@google.com/

The race can occur when the SVE trap handler is preempted before and
after manipulating the saved FPSIMD/SVE state, starting and ending on
the same CPU, e.g.

| void do_sve_acc(unsigned long esr, struct pt_regs *regs)
| {
|         // Trap on CPU 0 with TIF_SVE clear, SVE traps enabled
|         // task->fpsimd_cpu is 0.
|         // per_cpu_ptr(&fpsimd_last_state, 0) is task.
|
|         ...
|
|         // Preempted; migrated from CPU 0 to CPU 1.
|         // TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is set.
|
|         get_cpu_fpsimd_context();
|
|         if (test_and_set_thread_flag(TIF_SVE))
|                 WARN_ON(1); /* SVE access shouldn't have trapped */
|
|         sve_init_regs() {
|                 if (!test_thread_flag(TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE)) {
|                         ...
|                 } else {
|                         fpsimd_to_sve(current);
|                         current->thread.fp_type = FP_STATE_SVE;
|                 }
|         }
|
|         put_cpu_fpsimd_context();
|
|         // Preempted; migrated from CPU 1 to CPU 0.
|         // task->fpsimd_cpu is still 0
|         // If per_cpu_ptr(&fpsimd_last_state, 0) is still task then:
|         // - Stale HW state is reused (with SVE traps enabled)
|         // - TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is cleared
|         // - A return to userspace skips HW state restore
| }

Fix the case where the state is not live and TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is set
by calling fpsimd_flush_task_state() to detach from the saved CPU
state. This ensures that a subsequent context switch will not reuse the
stale CPU state, and will instead set TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE, forcing the
new state to be reloaded from memory prior to a return to userspace.",'-,7,961539,Rocky Linux Security Update for kernel (RLSA-2025:1068),4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 18, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,132185706,ptdtc-sv-ftp.portugal.pt,10.208.230.247,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:cf71,Refer to Rocky Linux security advisory RLSA-2025:1068 for updates and patch information.(https://errata.rockylinux.org/RLSA-2025:1068),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,SO:Rocky,Linux-PT,Group-8",No,No,35,12,"Feb 17, 2025","Feb 13, 2025",Rocky Linux,HIGH,High Lateral Movement,Rocky Linux 8.10,'-,'-,66,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability.",No,2,255,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-26935,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: core: Fix unremoved procfs host directory regression

Commit fc663711b944 (""scsi: core: Remove the /proc/scsi/${proc_name}
directory earlier"") fixed a bug related to modules loading/unloading, by
adding a call to scsi_proc_hostdir_rm() on scsi_remove_host(). But that led
to a potential duplicate call to the hostdir_rm() routine, since it's also
called from scsi_host_dev_release(). That triggered a regression report,
which was then fixed by commit be03df3d4bfe (""scsi: core: Fix a procfs host
directory removal regression""). The fix just dropped the hostdir_rm() call
from dev_release().

But it happens that this proc directory is created on scsi_host_alloc(),
and that function ""pairs"" with scsi_host_dev_release(), while
scsi_remove_host() pairs with scsi_add_host(). In other words, it seems the
reason for removing the proc directory on dev_release() was meant to cover
cases in which a SCSI host structure was allocated, but the call to
scsi_add_host() didn't happen. And that pattern happens to exist in some
error paths, for example.

Syzkaller causes that by using USB raw gadget device, error'ing on
usb-storage driver, at usb_stor_probe2(). By checking that path, we can see
that the BadDevice label leads to a scsi_host_put() after a SCSI host
allocation, but there's no call to scsi_add_host() in such path. That leads
to messages like this in dmesg (and a leak of the SCSI host proc
structure):

usb-storage 4-1:87.51: USB Mass Storage device detected
proc_dir_entry 'scsi/usb-storage' already registered
WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 3519 at fs/proc/generic.c:377 proc_register+0x347/0x4e0 fs/proc/generic.c:376

The proper fix seems to still call scsi_proc_hostdir_rm() on dev_release(),
but guard that with the state check for SHOST_CREATED; there is even a
comment in scsi_host_dev_release() detailing that: such conditional is
meant for cases where the SCSI host was allocated but there was no calls to
{add,remove}_host(), like the usb-storage case.

This is what we propose here and with that, the error path of usb-storage
does not trigger the warning anymore.",'-,'-,961539,Rocky Linux Security Update for kernel (RLSA-2025:1068),4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 19, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,132183274,ptdtc-sv-lxctrl.portugal.pt,10.208.230.248,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:2278,Refer to Rocky Linux security advisory RLSA-2025:1068 for updates and patch information.(https://errata.rockylinux.org/RLSA-2025:1068),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT,Group-4",No,No,'-,12,"Feb 17, 2025","Feb 13, 2025",Rocky Linux,HIGH,High Lateral Movement,Rocky Linux 8.10,'-,'-,64,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability.",No,2,256,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-50275,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64/sve: Discard stale CPU state when handling SVE traps

The logic for handling SVE traps manipulates saved FPSIMD/SVE state
incorrectly, and a race with preemption can result in a task having
TIF_SVE set and TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE clear even though the live CPU state
is stale (e.g. with SVE traps enabled). This has been observed to result
in warnings from do_sve_acc() where SVE traps are not expected while
TIF_SVE is set:

|         if (test_and_set_thread_flag(TIF_SVE))
|                 WARN_ON(1); /* SVE access shouldn't have trapped */

Warnings of this form have been reported intermittently, e.g.

  https://lore.kernel.org/linux-arm-kernel/CA+G9fYtEGe_DhY2Ms7+L7NKsLYUomGsgqpdBj+QwDLeSg=JhGg@mail.gmail.com/
  https://lore.kernel.org/linux-arm-kernel/000000000000511e9a060ce5a45c@google.com/

The race can occur when the SVE trap handler is preempted before and
after manipulating the saved FPSIMD/SVE state, starting and ending on
the same CPU, e.g.

| void do_sve_acc(unsigned long esr, struct pt_regs *regs)
| {
|         // Trap on CPU 0 with TIF_SVE clear, SVE traps enabled
|         // task->fpsimd_cpu is 0.
|         // per_cpu_ptr(&fpsimd_last_state, 0) is task.
|
|         ...
|
|         // Preempted; migrated from CPU 0 to CPU 1.
|         // TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is set.
|
|         get_cpu_fpsimd_context();
|
|         if (test_and_set_thread_flag(TIF_SVE))
|                 WARN_ON(1); /* SVE access shouldn't have trapped */
|
|         sve_init_regs() {
|                 if (!test_thread_flag(TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE)) {
|                         ...
|                 } else {
|                         fpsimd_to_sve(current);
|                         current->thread.fp_type = FP_STATE_SVE;
|                 }
|         }
|
|         put_cpu_fpsimd_context();
|
|         // Preempted; migrated from CPU 1 to CPU 0.
|         // task->fpsimd_cpu is still 0
|         // If per_cpu_ptr(&fpsimd_last_state, 0) is still task then:
|         // - Stale HW state is reused (with SVE traps enabled)
|         // - TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is cleared
|         // - A return to userspace skips HW state restore
| }

Fix the case where the state is not live and TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is set
by calling fpsimd_flush_task_state() to detach from the saved CPU
state. This ensures that a subsequent context switch will not reuse the
stale CPU state, and will instead set TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE, forcing the
new state to be reloaded from memory prior to a return to userspace.",'-,7,961539,Rocky Linux Security Update for kernel (RLSA-2025:1068),4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 19, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,132183274,ptdtc-sv-lxctrl.portugal.pt,10.208.230.248,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:2278,Refer to Rocky Linux security advisory RLSA-2025:1068 for updates and patch information.(https://errata.rockylinux.org/RLSA-2025:1068),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT,Group-4",No,No,35,12,"Feb 17, 2025","Feb 13, 2025",Rocky Linux,HIGH,High Lateral Movement,Rocky Linux 8.10,'-,'-,64,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability.",No,2,256,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-8508,"NLnet Labs Unbound up to and including version 1.21.0 contains a vulnerability when handling replies with very large RRsets that it needs to perform name compression for. Malicious upstreams responses with very large RRsets can cause Unbound to spend a considerable time applying name compression to downstream replies. This can lead to degraded performance and eventually denial of service in well orchestrated attacks. The vulnerability can be exploited by a malicious actor querying Unbound for the specially crafted contents of a malicious zone with very large RRsets. Before Unbound replies to the query it will try to apply name compression which was an unbounded operation that could lock the CPU until the whole packet was complete. Unbound version 1.21.1 introduces a hard limit on the number of name compression calculations it is willing to do per packet. Packets that need more compression will result in semi-compressed packets or truncated packets, even on TCP for huge messages, to avoid locking the CPU for long.

CVE-2024-26935,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: core: Fix unremoved procfs host directory regression

Commit fc663711b944 (""scsi: core: Remove the /proc/scsi/${proc_name}
directory earlier"") fixed a bug related to modules loading/unloading, by
adding a call to scsi_proc_hostdir_rm() on scsi_remove_host(). But that led
to a potential duplicate call to the hostdir_rm() routine, since it's also
called from scsi_host_dev_release(). That triggered a regression report,
which was then fixed by commit be03df3d4bfe (""scsi: core: Fix a procfs host
directory removal regression""). The fix just dropped the hostdir_rm() call
from dev_release().

But it happens that this proc directory is created on scsi_host_alloc(),
and that function ""pairs"" with scsi_host_dev_release(), while
scsi_remove_host() pairs with scsi_add_host(). In other words, it seems the
reason for removing the proc directory on dev_release() was meant to cover
cases in which a SCSI host structure was allocated, but the call to
scsi_add_host() didn't happen. And that pattern happens to exist in some
error paths, for example.

Syzkaller causes that by using USB raw gadget device, error'ing on
usb-storage driver, at usb_stor_probe2(). By checking that path, we can see
that the BadDevice label leads to a scsi_host_put() after a SCSI host
allocation, but there's no call to scsi_add_host() in such path. That leads
to messages like this in dmesg (and a leak of the SCSI host proc
structure):

usb-storage 4-1:87.51: USB Mass Storage device detected

WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 3519 at fs/proc/generic.c:377 proc_register+0x347/0x4e0 fs/proc/generic.c:376

The proper fix seems to still call scsi_proc_hostdir_rm() on dev_release(),
but guard that with the state check for SHOST_CREATED; there is even a
comment in scsi_host_dev_release() detailing that: such conditional is
meant for cases where the SCSI host was allocated but there was no calls to
{add,remove}_host(), like the usb-storage case.

CVE-2024-50275,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64/sve: Discard stale CPU state when handling SVE traps

The logic for handling SVE traps manipulates saved FPSIMD/SVE state
incorrectly, and a race with preemption can result in a task having
TIF_SVE set and TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE clear even though the live CPU state
is stale (e.g. with SVE traps enabled). This has been observed to result
in warnings from do_sve_acc() where SVE traps are not expected while
TIF_SVE is set:

|         if (test_and_set_thread_flag(TIF_SVE))
|                 WARN_ON(1); /* SVE access shouldn't have trapped */

Warnings of this form have been reported intermittently, e.g.

  https://lore.kernel.org/linux-arm-kernel/CA+G9fYtEGe_DhY2Ms7+L7NKsLYUomGsgqpdBj+QwDLeSg=JhGg@mail.gmail.com/
  https://lore.kernel.org/linux-arm-kernel/000000000000511e9a060ce5a45c@google.com/

The race can occur when the SVE trap handler is preempted before and
after manipulating the saved FPSIMD/SVE state, starting and ending on
the same CPU, e.g.

| void do_sve_acc(unsigned long esr, struct pt_regs *regs)
| {
|         // Trap on CPU 0 with TIF_SVE clear, SVE traps enabled
|         // task->fpsimd_cpu is 0.
|         // per_cpu_ptr(&fpsimd_last_state, 0) is task.
|
|         ...
|
|         // Preempted; migrated from CPU 0 to CPU 1.
|         // TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is set.
|
|         get_cpu_fpsimd_context();
|
|         if (test_and_set_thread_flag(TIF_SVE))
|                 WARN_ON(1); /* SVE access shouldn't have trapped */
|
|         sve_init_regs() {
|                 if (!test_thread_flag(TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE)) {
|                         ...
|                 } else {
|                         fpsimd_to_sve(current);
|                         current->thread.fp_type = FP_STATE_SVE;
|                 }
|         }
|
|         put_cpu_fpsimd_context();
|
|         // Preempted; migrated from CPU 1 to CPU 0.
|         // task->fpsimd_cpu is still 0
|         // If per_cpu_ptr(&fpsimd_last_state, 0) is still task then:
|         // - Stale HW state is reused (with SVE traps enabled)
|         // - TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is cleared
|         // - A return to userspace skips HW state restore
| }

Fix the case where the state is not live and TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is set
by calling fpsimd_flush_task_state() to detach from the saved CPU
state. This ensures that a subsequent context switch will not reuse the
stale CPU state, and will instead set TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE, forcing the
new state to be reloaded from memory prior to a return to userspace.",'-,7,961539,Rocky Linux Security Update for kernel (RLSA-2025:1068),4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 18, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,132177971,ptdtc-sv-iris09.portugal.pt,10.200.8.206,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:5bcc,Refer to Rocky Linux security advisory RLSA-2025:1068 for updates and patch information.(https://errata.rockylinux.org/RLSA-2025:1068),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT,Group-7",No,No,35,12,"Feb 17, 2025","Feb 13, 2025",Rocky Linux,HIGH,High Lateral Movement,Rocky Linux 8.10,'-,'-,74,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability.",No,2,343,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-8508,"NLnet Labs Unbound up to and including version 1.21.0 contains a vulnerability when handling replies with very large RRsets that it needs to perform name compression for. Malicious upstreams responses with very large RRsets can cause Unbound to spend a considerable time applying name compression to downstream replies. This can lead to degraded performance and eventually denial of service in well orchestrated attacks. The vulnerability can be exploited by a malicious actor querying Unbound for the specially crafted contents of a malicious zone with very large RRsets. Before Unbound replies to the query it will try to apply name compression which was an unbounded operation that could lock the CPU until the whole packet was complete. Unbound version 1.21.1 introduces a hard limit on the number of name compression calculations it is willing to do per packet.

CVE-2024-26935,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: core: Fix unremoved procfs host directory regression

Commit fc663711b944 (""scsi: core: Remove the /proc/scsi/${proc_name}
directory earlier"") fixed a bug related to modules loading/unloading, by
adding a call to scsi_proc_hostdir_rm() on scsi_remove_host(). But that led
to a potential duplicate call to the hostdir_rm() routine, since it's also
called from scsi_host_dev_release(). That triggered a regression report,
which was then fixed by commit be03df3d4bfe (""scsi: core: Fix a procfs host
directory removal regression""). The fix just dropped the hostdir_rm() call
from dev_release().

But it happens that this proc directory is created on scsi_host_alloc(),
and that function ""pairs"" with scsi_host_dev_release(), while
scsi_remove_host() pairs with scsi_add_host(). In other words, it seems the
reason for removing the proc directory on dev_release() was meant to cover
cases in which a SCSI host structure was allocated, but the call to
scsi_add_host() didn't happen. And that pattern happens to exist in some
error paths, for example.

Syzkaller causes that by using USB raw gadget device, error'ing on
usb-storage driver, at usb_stor_probe2(). By checking that path, we can see
that the BadDevice label leads to a scsi_host_put() after a SCSI host
allocation, but there's no call to scsi_add_host() in such path. That leads
to messages like this in dmesg (and a leak of the SCSI host proc
structure):

usb-storage 4-1:87.51: USB Mass Storage device detected
proc_dir_entry 'scsi/usb-storage' already registered
WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 3519 at fs/proc/generic.c:377 proc_register+0x347/0x4e0 fs/proc/generic.c:376

The proper fix seems to still call scsi_proc_hostdir_rm() on dev_release(),
but guard that with the state check for SHOST_CREATED; there is even a
comment in scsi_host_dev_release() detailing that: such conditional is
meant for cases where the SCSI host was allocated but there was no calls to
{add,remove}_host(), like the usb-storage case.

This is what we propose here and with that, the error path of usb-storage
does not trigger the warning anymore.",'-,'-,961539,Rocky Linux Security Update for kernel (RLSA-2025:1068),4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 18, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,132177001,ptdtc-sv-iris11.portugal.pt,10.200.8.208,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:f317,Refer to Rocky Linux security advisory RLSA-2025:1068 for updates and patch information.(https://errata.rockylinux.org/RLSA-2025:1068),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT,Group-7",No,No,'-,12,"Feb 17, 2025","Feb 13, 2025",Rocky Linux,HIGH,High Lateral Movement,Rocky Linux 8.10,'-,'-,74,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability.",No,2,345,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-50275,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64/sve: Discard stale CPU state when handling SVE traps

The logic for handling SVE traps manipulates saved FPSIMD/SVE state
incorrectly, and a race with preemption can result in a task having
TIF_SVE set and TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE clear even though the live CPU state
is stale (e.g. with SVE traps enabled). This has been observed to result
in warnings from do_sve_acc() where SVE traps are not expected while
TIF_SVE is set:

CVE-2024-26935,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: core: Fix unremoved procfs host directory regression

Commit fc663711b944 (""scsi: core: Remove the /proc/scsi/${proc_name}
directory earlier"") fixed a bug related to modules loading/unloading, by
adding a call to scsi_proc_hostdir_rm() on scsi_remove_host(). But that led
to a potential duplicate call to the hostdir_rm() routine, since it's also
called from scsi_host_dev_release(). That triggered a regression report,
which was then fixed by commit be03df3d4bfe (""scsi: core: Fix a procfs host
directory removal regression""). The fix just dropped the hostdir_rm() call
from dev_release().

But it happens that this proc directory is created on scsi_host_alloc(),
and that function ""pairs"" with scsi_host_dev_release(), while
scsi_remove_host() pairs with scsi_add_host(). In other words, it seems the
reason for removing the proc directory on dev_release() was meant to cover
cases in which a SCSI host structure was allocated, but the call to
scsi_add_host() didn't happen. And that pattern happens to exist in some
error paths, for example.

Syzkaller causes that by using USB raw gadget device, error'ing on
usb-storage driver, at usb_stor_probe2(). By checking that path, we can see
that the BadDevice label leads to a scsi_host_put() after a SCSI host
allocation, but there's no call to scsi_add_host() in such path. That leads
to messages like this in dmesg (and a leak of the SCSI host proc
structure):

usb-storage 4-1:87.51: USB Mass Storage device detected
proc_dir_entry 'scsi/usb-storage' already registered
WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 3519 at fs/proc/generic.c:377 proc_register+0x347/0x4e0 fs/proc/generic.c:376

The proper fix seems to still call scsi_proc_hostdir_rm() on dev_release(),
but guard that with the state check for SHOST_CREATED; there is even a
comment in scsi_host_dev_release() detailing that: such conditional is
meant for cases where the SCSI host was allocated but there was no calls to
{add,remove}_host(), like the usb-storage case.

This is what we propose here and with that, the error path of usb-storage
does not trigger the warning anymore.",'-,'-,961539,Rocky Linux Security Update for kernel (RLSA-2025:1068),4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 18, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,132181692,ptdtc-sv-iris07.portugal.pt,10.200.8.204,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:29bf,Refer to Rocky Linux security advisory RLSA-2025:1068 for updates and patch information.(https://errata.rockylinux.org/RLSA-2025:1068),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT,Group-7",No,No,'-,12,"Feb 17, 2025","Feb 13, 2025",Rocky Linux,HIGH,High Lateral Movement,Rocky Linux 8.10,'-,'-,68,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability.",No,2,341,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-50275,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64/sve: Discard stale CPU state when handling SVE traps

The logic for handling SVE traps manipulates saved FPSIMD/SVE state
incorrectly, and a race with preemption can result in a task having
TIF_SVE set and TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE clear even though the live CPU state
is stale (e.g. with SVE traps enabled). This has been observed to result
in warnings from do_sve_acc() where SVE traps are not expected while
TIF_SVE is set:

|         if (test_and_set_thread_flag(TIF_SVE))
|                 WARN_ON(1); /* SVE access shouldn't have trapped */

Warnings of this form have been reported intermittently, e.g.

  https://lore.kernel.org/linux-arm-kernel/CA+G9fYtEGe_DhY2Ms7+L7NKsLYUomGsgqpdBj+QwDLeSg=JhGg@mail.gmail.com/
  https://lore.kernel.org/linux-arm-kernel/000000000000511e9a060ce5a45c@google.com/

The race can occur when the SVE trap handler is preempted before and
after manipulating the saved FPSIMD/SVE state, starting and ending on
the same CPU, e.g.

| void do_sve_acc(unsigned long esr, struct pt_regs *regs)
| {
|         // Trap on CPU 0 with TIF_SVE clear, SVE traps enabled
|         // task->fpsimd_cpu is 0.
|         // per_cpu_ptr(&fpsimd_last_state, 0) is task.
|
|         ...
|
|         // Preempted; migrated from CPU 0 to CPU 1.
|         // TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is set.
|
|         get_cpu_fpsimd_context();
|
|         if (test_and_set_thread_flag(TIF_SVE))
|                 WARN_ON(1); /* SVE access shouldn't have trapped */
|
|         sve_init_regs() {
|                 if (!test_thread_flag(TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE)) {
|                         ...
|                 } else {
|                         fpsimd_to_sve(current);
|                         current->thread.fp_type = FP_STATE_SVE;
|                 }
|         }
|
|         put_cpu_fpsimd_context();
|
|         // Preempted; migrated from CPU 1 to CPU 0.
|         // task->fpsimd_cpu is still 0
|         // If per_cpu_ptr(&fpsimd_last_state, 0) is still task then:
|         // - Stale HW state is reused (with SVE traps enabled)
|         // - TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is cleared
|         // - A return to userspace skips HW state restore
| }

Fix the case where the state is not live and TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is set
by calling fpsimd_flush_task_state() to detach from the saved CPU
state. This ensures that a subsequent context switch will not reuse the
stale CPU state, and will instead set TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE, forcing the
new state to be reloaded from memory prior to a return to userspace.",'-,7,961539,Rocky Linux Security Update for kernel (RLSA-2025:1068),4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 18, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,132181692,ptdtc-sv-iris07.portugal.pt,10.200.8.204,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:29bf,Refer to Rocky Linux security advisory RLSA-2025:1068 for updates and patch information.(https://errata.rockylinux.org/RLSA-2025:1068),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT,Group-7",No,No,35,12,"Feb 17, 2025","Feb 13, 2025",Rocky Linux,HIGH,High Lateral Movement,Rocky Linux 8.10,'-,'-,68,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability.",No,2,341,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-8508,"NLnet Labs Unbound up to and including version 1.21.0 contains a vulnerability when handling replies with very large RRsets that it needs to perform name compression for. Malicious upstreams responses with very large RRsets can cause Unbound to spend a considerable time applying name compression to downstream replies. This can lead to degraded performance and eventually denial of service in well orchestrated attacks. The vulnerability can be exploited by a malicious actor querying Unbound for the specially crafted contents of a malicious zone with very large RRsets. Before Unbound replies to the query it will try to apply name compression which was an unbounded operation that could lock the CPU until the whole packet was complete. Unbound version 1.21.1 introduces a hard limit on the number of name compression calculations it is willing to do per packet. Packets that need more compression will result in semi-compressed packets or truncated packets, even on TCP for huge messages, to avoid locking the CPU for long.

CVE-2024-26935,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: core: Fix unremoved procfs host directory regression

Commit fc663711b944 (""scsi: core: Remove the /proc/scsi/${proc_name}
directory earlier"") fixed a bug related to modules loading/unloading, by
adding a call to scsi_proc_hostdir_rm() on scsi_remove_host(). But that led
to a potential duplicate call to the hostdir_rm() routine, since it's also
called from scsi_host_dev_release(). That triggered a regression report,
which was then fixed by commit be03df3d4bfe (""scsi: core: Fix a procfs host
directory removal regression""). The fix just dropped the hostdir_rm() call
from dev_release().

But it happens that this proc directory is created on scsi_host_alloc(),
and that function ""pairs"" with scsi_host_dev_release(), while
scsi_remove_host() pairs with scsi_add_host(). In other words, it seems the
reason for removing the proc directory on dev_release() was meant to cover
cases in which a SCSI host structure was allocated, but the call to
scsi_add_host() didn't happen. And that pattern happens to exist in some
error paths, for example.

Syzkaller causes that by using USB raw gadget device, error'ing on
usb-storage driver, at usb_stor_probe2(). By checking that path, we can see
that the BadDevice label leads to a scsi_host_put() after a SCSI host
allocation, but there's no call to scsi_add_host() in such path. That leads
to messages like this in dmesg (and a leak of the SCSI host proc
structure):

usb-storage 4-1:87.51: USB Mass Storage device detected
proc_dir_entry 'scsi/usb-storage' already registered
WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 3519 at fs/proc/generic.c:377 proc_register+0x347/0x4e0 fs/proc/generic.c:376

The proper fix seems to still call scsi_proc_hostdir_rm() on dev_release(),
but guard that with the state check for SHOST_CREATED; there is even a
comment in scsi_host_dev_release() detailing that: such conditional is
meant for cases where the SCSI host was allocated but there was no calls to
{add,remove}_host(), like the usb-storage case.

This is what we propose here and with that, the error path of usb-storage
does not trigger the warning anymore.",'-,'-,961539,Rocky Linux Security Update for kernel (RLSA-2025:1068),4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 18, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,125226296,ptprt-suapi04.portugal.pt,"10.200.1.176,172.17.0.1,172.18.0.1,172.19.0.1","fe80:0:0:0:42:8bff:fe48:be08,fe80:0:0:0:42:a5ff:fe6a:9ca3,fe80:0:0:0:42:faff:fe9b:2736,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:6260,fe80:0:0:0:4815:ffff:fe9f:e47,fe80:0:0:0:5802:d0ff:fee3:7b07,fe80:0:0:0:60c0:70ff:fe05:181d,fe80:0:0:0:900c:b8ff:fe01:552,fe80:0:0:0:f807:ddff:fe6b:dea4",Refer to Rocky Linux security advisory RLSA-2025:1068 for updates and patch information.(https://errata.rockylinux.org/RLSA-2025:1068),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT,Group-5",No,No,'-,12,"Feb 17, 2025","Feb 13, 2025",Rocky Linux,HIGH,High Lateral Movement,Rocky Linux 8.10,'-,'-,68,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability.",No,2,347,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-50275,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64/sve: Discard stale CPU state when handling SVE traps

The logic for handling SVE traps manipulates saved FPSIMD/SVE state
incorrectly, and a race with preemption can result in a task having
TIF_SVE set and TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE clear even though the live CPU state
is stale (e.g. with SVE traps enabled). This has been observed to result
in warnings from do_sve_acc() where SVE traps are not expected while
TIF_SVE is set:

|         if (test_and_set_thread_flag(TIF_SVE))
|                 WARN_ON(1); /* SVE access shouldn't have trapped */

Warnings of this form have been reported intermittently, e.g.

  https://lore.kernel.org/linux-arm-kernel/CA+G9fYtEGe_DhY2Ms7+L7NKsLYUomGsgqpdBj+QwDLeSg=JhGg@mail.gmail.com/
  https://lore.kernel.org/linux-arm-kernel/000000000000511e9a060ce5a45c@google.com/

The race can occur when the SVE trap handler is preempted before and
after manipulating the saved FPSIMD/SVE state, starting and ending on
the same CPU, e.g.

| void do_sve_acc(unsigned long esr, struct pt_regs *regs)
| {
|         // Trap on CPU 0 with TIF_SVE clear, SVE traps enabled
|         // task->fpsimd_cpu is 0.
|         // per_cpu_ptr(&fpsimd_last_state, 0) is task.
|
|         ...
|
|         // Preempted; migrated from CPU 0 to CPU 1.
|         // TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is set.
|
|         get_cpu_fpsimd_context();
|
|         if (test_and_set_thread_flag(TIF_SVE))
|                 WARN_ON(1); /* SVE access shouldn't have trapped */
|
|         sve_init_regs() {
|                 if (!test_thread_flag(TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE)) {
|                         ...
|                 } else {
|                         fpsimd_to_sve(current);
|                         current->thread.fp_type = FP_STATE_SVE;
|                 }
|         }
|
|         put_cpu_fpsimd_context();
|
|         // Preempted; migrated from CPU 1 to CPU 0.
|         // task->fpsimd_cpu is still 0
|         // If per_cpu_ptr(&fpsimd_last_state, 0) is still task then:
|         // - Stale HW state is reused (with SVE traps enabled)
|         // - TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is cleared
|         // - A return to userspace skips HW state restore
| }

Fix the case where the state is not live and TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is set
by calling fpsimd_flush_task_state() to detach from the saved CPU
state. This ensures that a subsequent context switch will not reuse the
stale CPU state, and will instead set TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE, forcing the
new state to be reloaded from memory prior to a return to userspace.",'-,7,961539,Rocky Linux Security Update for kernel (RLSA-2025:1068),4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 18, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,125226296,ptprt-suapi04.portugal.pt,"10.200.1.176,172.17.0.1,172.18.0.1,172.19.0.1","fe80:0:0:0:42:8bff:fe48:be08,fe80:0:0:0:42:a5ff:fe6a:9ca3,fe80:0:0:0:42:faff:fe9b:2736,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:6260,fe80:0:0:0:4815:ffff:fe9f:e47,fe80:0:0:0:5802:d0ff:fee3:7b07,fe80:0:0:0:60c0:70ff:fe05:181d,fe80:0:0:0:900c:b8ff:fe01:552,fe80:0:0:0:f807:ddff:fe6b:dea4",Refer to Rocky Linux security advisory RLSA-2025:1068 for updates and patch information.(https://errata.rockylinux.org/RLSA-2025:1068),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT,Group-5",No,No,35,12,"Feb 17, 2025","Feb 13, 2025",Rocky Linux,HIGH,High Lateral Movement,Rocky Linux 8.10,'-,'-,68,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability.",No,2,347,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-29018,"Moby is an open source container framework that is a key component of Docker Engine, Docker Desktop, and other distributions of container tooling or runtimes. Moby's networking implementation allows for many networks, each with their own IP address range and gateway, to be defined. This feature is frequently referred to as custom networks, as each network can have a different driver, set of parameters and thus behaviors. When creating a network, the `--internal` flag is used to designate a network as _internal_. The `internal` attribute in a docker-compose.yml file may also be used to mark a network _internal_, and other API clients may specify the `internal` parameter as well.

When containers with networking are created, they are assigned unique network interfaces and IP addresses. The host serves as a router for non-internal networks, with a gateway IP that provides SNAT/DNAT to/from container IPs.

Containers on an internal network may communicate between each other, but are precluded from communicating with any networks the host has access to (LAN or WAN) as no default route is configured, and firewall rules are set up to drop all outgoing traffic. Communication with the gateway IP address (and thus appropriately configured host services) is possible, and the host may communicate with any container IP directly.

In addition to configuring the Linux kernel's various networking features to enable container networking, `dockerd` directly provides some services to container networks. Principal among these is serving as a resolver, enabling service discovery, and resolution of names from an upstream resolver.

When a DNS request for a name that does not correspond to a container is received, the request is forwarded to the configured upstream resolver. This request is made from the container's network namespace: the level of access and routing of traffic is the same as if the request was made by the container itself.

As a consequence of this design, containers solely attached to an internal network will be unable to resolve names using the upstream resolver, as the container itself is unable to communicate with that nameserver. Only the names of containers also attached to the internal network are able to be resolved.

Many systems run a local forwarding DNS resolver. As the host and any containers have separate loopback devices, a consequence of the design described above is that containers are unable to resolve names from the host's configured resolver, as they cannot reach these addresses on the host loopback device. To bridge this gap, and to allow containers to properly resolve names even when a local forwarding resolver is used on a loopback address, `dockerd` detects this scenario and instead forward DNS requests from the host namework namespace. The loopback resolver then forwards the requests to its configured upstream resolvers, as expected.

Because `dockerd` forwards DNS requests to the host loopback device, bypassing the container network namespace's normal routing semantics entirely, internal networks can unexpectedly forward DNS requests to an external nameserver. By registering a domain for which they control the authoritative nameservers, an attacker could arrange for a compromised container to exfiltrate data by encoding it in DNS queries that will eventually be answered by their nameservers.

Docker Desktop is not affected, as Docker Desktop always runs an internal resolver on a RFC 1918 address.

Moby releases 26.0.0, 25.0.4, and 23.0.11 are patched to prevent forwarding any DNS requests from internal networks. As a workaround, run containers intended to be solely attached to internal networks with a custom upstream address, which will force all upstream DNS queries to be resolved from the container's network namespace.",'-,'-,6021664,Ubuntu Security Notification for Docker Vulnerabilities (USN-7161-2),5,5,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 20, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,176268272,ptdtc-sv-klims1.portugal.pt,"10.200.6.150,172.17.0.1",fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:fe83:c7aa,Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7161-2 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7161-2),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT,tmp_pt_servers_hva",No,No,30,11,"Feb 19, 2025","Feb 18, 2025",Ubuntu,CRITICAL,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,Remote Code Execution,Privilege Escalation",Ubuntu Linux 20.04.6,'-,'-,59,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",No,2,331,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-41110,"Moby is an open-source project created by Docker for software containerization. A security vulnerability has been detected in certain versions of Docker Engine, which could allow an attacker to bypass authorization plugins (AuthZ) under specific circumstances. The base likelihood of this being exploited is low.

Using a specially-crafted API request, an Engine API client could make the daemon forward the request or response to an authorization plugin without the body. In certain circumstances, the authorization plugin may allow a request which it would have otherwise denied if the body had been forwarded to it.

A security issue was discovered In 2018, where an attacker could bypass AuthZ plugins using a specially crafted API request. This could lead to unauthorized actions, including privilege escalation. Although this issue was fixed in Docker Engine v18.09.1 in January 2019, the fix was not carried forward to later major versions, resulting in a regression. Anyone who depends on authorization plugins that introspect the request and/or response body to make access control decisions is potentially impacted.

Docker EE v19.03.x and all versions of Mirantis Container Runtime are not vulnerable.

docker-ce v27.1.1 containes patches to fix the vulnerability. Patches have also been merged into the master, 19.03, 20.0, 23.0, 24.0, 25.0, 26.0, and 26.1 release branches.

CVE-2024-29018,"Moby is an open source container framework that is a key component of Docker Engine, Docker Desktop, and other distributions of container tooling or runtimes. Moby's networking implementation allows for many networks, each with their own IP address range and gateway, to be defined. This feature is frequently referred to as custom networks, as each network can have a different driver, set of parameters and thus behaviors. When creating a network, the `--internal` flag is used to designate a network as _internal_. The `internal` attribute in a docker-compose.yml file may also be used to mark a network _internal_, and other API clients may specify the `internal` parameter as well.

When containers with networking are created, they are assigned unique network interfaces and IP addresses. The host serves as a router for non-internal networks, with a gateway IP that provides SNAT/DNAT to/from container IPs.

Containers on an internal network may communicate between each other, but are precluded from communicating with any networks the host has access to (LAN or WAN) as no default route is configured, and firewall rules are set up to drop all outgoing traffic. Communication with the gateway IP address (and thus appropriately configured host services) is possible, and the host may communicate with any container IP directly.

In addition to configuring the Linux kernel's various networking features to enable container networking, `dockerd` directly provides some services to container networks. Principal among these is serving as a resolver, enabling service discovery, and resolution of names from an upstream resolver.

When a DNS request for a name that does not correspond to a container is received, the request is forwarded to the configured upstream resolver. This request is made from the container's network namespace: the level of access and routing of traffic is the same as if the request was made by the container itself.

As a consequence of this design, containers solely attached to an internal network will be unable to resolve names using the upstream resolver, as the container itself is unable to communicate with that nameserver. Only the names of containers also attached to the internal network are able to be resolved.

Many systems run a local forwarding DNS resolver. As the host and any containers have separate loopback devices, a consequence of the design described above is that containers are unable to resolve names from the host's configured resolver, as they cannot reach these addresses on the host loopback device. To bridge this gap, and to allow containers to properly resolve names even when a local forwarding resolver is used on a loopback address, `dockerd` detects this scenario and instead forward DNS requests from the host namework namespace. The loopback resolver then forwards the requests to its configured upstream resolvers, as expected.

Because `dockerd` forwards DNS requests to the host loopback device, bypassing the container network namespace's normal routing semantics entirely, internal networks can unexpectedly forward DNS requests to an external nameserver. By registering a domain for which they control the authoritative nameservers, an attacker could arrange for a compromised container to exfiltrate data by encoding it in DNS queries that will eventually be answered by their nameservers.

Docker Desktop is not affected, as Docker Desktop always runs an internal resolver on a RFC 1918 address.

Moby releases 26.0.0, 25.0.4, and 23.0.11 are patched to prevent forwarding any DNS requests from internal networks. As a workaround, run containers intended to be solely attached to internal networks with a custom upstream address, which will force all upstream DNS queries to be resolved from the container's network namespace.",'-,'-,6021664,Ubuntu Security Notification for Docker Vulnerabilities (USN-7161-2),5,5,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 19, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,223994195,ptdtc-sv-klmsq1.portugal.pt,"10.200.4.150,172.17.0.1",fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:87d7,Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7161-2 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7161-2),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,30,11,"Feb 19, 2025","Feb 18, 2025",Ubuntu,CRITICAL,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,Remote Code Execution,Privilege Escalation",Ubuntu Linux 20.04.6,'-,'-,60,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",No,2,331,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-41110,"Moby is an open-source project created by Docker for software containerization. A security vulnerability has been detected in certain versions of Docker Engine, which could allow an attacker to bypass authorization plugins (AuthZ) under specific circumstances. The base likelihood of this being exploited is low.

Using a specially-crafted API request, an Engine API client could make the daemon forward the request or response to an authorization plugin without the body. In certain circumstances, the authorization plugin may allow a request which it would have otherwise denied if the body had been forwarded to it.

A security issue was discovered In 2018, where an attacker could bypass AuthZ plugins using a specially crafted API request. This could lead to unauthorized actions, including privilege escalation. Although this issue was fixed in Docker Engine v18.09.1 in January 2019, the fix was not carried forward to later major versions, resulting in a regression. Anyone who depends on authorization plugins that introspect the request and/or response body to make access control decisions is potentially impacted.

Docker EE v19.03.x and all versions of Mirantis Container Runtime are not vulnerable.

docker-ce v27.1.1 containes patches to fix the vulnerability. Patches have also been merged into the master, 19.03, 20.0, 23.0, 24.0, 25.0, 26.0, and 26.1 release branches.

CVE-2024-26935,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: core: Fix unremoved procfs host directory regression

Commit fc663711b944 (""scsi: core: Remove the /proc/scsi/${proc_name}
directory earlier"") fixed a bug related to modules loading/unloading, by
adding a call to scsi_proc_hostdir_rm() on scsi_remove_host(). But that led
to a potential duplicate call to the hostdir_rm() routine, since it's also
called from scsi_host_dev_release(). That triggered a regression report,
which was then fixed by commit be03df3d4bfe (""scsi: core: Fix a procfs host
directory removal regression""). The fix just dropped the hostdir_rm() call
from dev_release().

But it happens that this proc directory is created on scsi_host_alloc(),
and that function ""pairs"" with scsi_host_dev_release(), while
scsi_remove_host() pairs with scsi_add_host(). In other words, it seems the
reason for removing the proc directory on dev_release() was meant to cover
cases in which a SCSI host structure was allocated, but the call to
scsi_add_host() didn't happen. And that pattern happens to exist in some
error paths, for example.

Syzkaller causes that by using USB raw gadget device, error'ing on
usb-storage driver, at usb_stor_probe2(). By checking that path, we can see
that the BadDevice label leads to a scsi_host_put() after a SCSI host
allocation, but there's no call to scsi_add_host() in such path. That leads
to messages like this in dmesg (and a leak of the SCSI host proc
structure):

usb-storage 4-1:87.51: USB Mass Storage device detected
proc_dir_entry 'scsi/usb-storage' already registered
WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 3519 at fs/proc/generic.c:377 proc_register+0x347/0x4e0 fs/proc/generic.c:376

The proper fix seems to still call scsi_proc_hostdir_rm() on dev_release(),
but guard that with the state check for SHOST_CREATED; there is even a
comment in scsi_host_dev_release() detailing that: such conditional is
meant for cases where the SCSI host was allocated but there was no calls to
{add,remove}_host(), like the usb-storage case.

This is what we propose here and with that, the error path of usb-storage
does not trigger the warning anymore.",'-,'-,961539,Rocky Linux Security Update for kernel (RLSA-2025:1068),4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 18, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,197468040,demo-linux2ad-2.portugal.pt,10.200.3.2,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:f849,Refer to Rocky Linux security advisory RLSA-2025:1068 for updates and patch information.(https://errata.rockylinux.org/RLSA-2025:1068),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,'-,12,"Feb 17, 2025","Feb 13, 2025",Rocky Linux,HIGH,High Lateral Movement,Rocky Linux 8.10,'-,'-,32,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability.",No,2,203,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-50275,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64/sve: Discard stale CPU state when handling SVE traps

The logic for handling SVE traps manipulates saved FPSIMD/SVE state
incorrectly, and a race with preemption can result in a task having
TIF_SVE set and TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE clear even though the live CPU state
is stale (e.g. with SVE traps enabled). This has been observed to result
in warnings from do_sve_acc() where SVE traps are not expected while
TIF_SVE is set:

|         if (test_and_set_thread_flag(TIF_SVE))
|                 WARN_ON(1); /* SVE access shouldn't have trapped */

Warnings of this form have been reported intermittently, e.g.

  https://lore.kernel.org/linux-arm-kernel/CA+G9fYtEGe_DhY2Ms7+L7NKsLYUomGsgqpdBj+QwDLeSg=JhGg@mail.gmail.com/
  https://lore.kernel.org/linux-arm-kernel/000000000000511e9a060ce5a45c@google.com/

The race can occur when the SVE trap handler is preempted before and
after manipulating the saved FPSIMD/SVE state, starting and ending on
the same CPU, e.g.

| void do_sve_acc(unsigned long esr, struct pt_regs *regs)
| {
|         // Trap on CPU 0 with TIF_SVE clear, SVE traps enabled
|         // task->fpsimd_cpu is 0.
|         // per_cpu_ptr(&fpsimd_last_state, 0) is task.
|
|         ...
|
|         // Preempted; migrated from CPU 0 to CPU 1.
|         // TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is set.
|
|         get_cpu_fpsimd_context();
|
|         if (test_and_set_thread_flag(TIF_SVE))
|                 WARN_ON(1); /* SVE access shouldn't have trapped */
|
|         sve_init_regs() {
|                 if (!test_thread_flag(TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE)) {
|                         ...
|                 } else {
|                         fpsimd_to_sve(current);
|                         current->thread.fp_type = FP_STATE_SVE;
|                 }
|         }
|
|         put_cpu_fpsimd_context();
|
|         // Preempted; migrated from CPU 1 to CPU 0.
|         // task->fpsimd_cpu is still 0
|         // If per_cpu_ptr(&fpsimd_last_state, 0) is still task then:
|         // - Stale HW state is reused (with SVE traps enabled)
|         // - TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is cleared
|         // - A return to userspace skips HW state restore
| }

Fix the case where the state is not live and TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is set
by calling fpsimd_flush_task_state() to detach from the saved CPU
state. This ensures that a subsequent context switch will not reuse the
stale CPU state, and will instead set TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE, forcing the
new state to be reloaded from memory prior to a return to userspace.",'-,7,961539,Rocky Linux Security Update for kernel (RLSA-2025:1068),4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 18, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,197468040,demo-linux2ad-2.portugal.pt,10.200.3.2,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:f849,Refer to Rocky Linux security advisory RLSA-2025:1068 for updates and patch information.(https://errata.rockylinux.org/RLSA-2025:1068),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,35,12,"Feb 17, 2025","Feb 13, 2025",Rocky Linux,HIGH,High Lateral Movement,Rocky Linux 8.10,'-,'-,32,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability.",No,2,203,,"#table cols=""3""

The intent of the verifcation done in check_flush_depedency is to ensure
forward progress during memory reclaim, by flagging cases when either a
memory reclaim process, or a memory reclaim work item is flushed from a
context not marked as memory reclaim safe.

This is correct when flushing, but when called from the
cancel(_delayed)_work_sync() paths it is a false positive because work is
either already running, or will not be running at all. Therefore
cancelling it is safe and we can relax the warning criteria by letting the
helper know of the calling context.

mm/mempolicy: fix migrate_to_node() assuming there is at least one VMA in a MM

We currently assume that there is at least one VMA in a MM, which isn't

So we might end up having find_vma() return NULL, to then de-reference
NULL.  So properly handle find_vma() returning NULL.

CVE-2024-53088,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

i40e: fix race condition by adding filter's intermediate sync state

Fix a race condition in the i40e driver that leads to MAC/VLAN filters
becoming corrupted and leaking. Address the issue that occurs under
heavy load when multiple threads are concurrently modifying MAC/VLAN
filters by setting mac and port VLAN.

1. Thread T0 allocates a filter in i40e_add_filter() within
        i40e_ndo_set_vf_port_vlan().
2. Thread T1 concurrently frees the filter in __i40e_del_filter() within
        i40e_ndo_set_vf_mac().
3. Subsequently, i40e_service_task() calls i40e_sync_vsi_filters(), which
        refers to the already freed filter memory, causing corruption.

Reproduction steps:
1. Spawn multiple VFs.
2. Apply a concurrent heavy load by running parallel operations to change
        MAC addresses on the VFs and change port VLANs on the host.
3. Observe errors in dmesg:
""Error I40E_AQ_RC_ENOSPC adding RX filters on VF XX,
	please set promiscuous on manually for VF XX"".

Exact code for stable reproduction Intel can't open-source now.

The fix involves implementing a new intermediate filter state,
I40E_FILTER_NEW_SYNC, for the time when a filter is on a tmp_add_list.

must be removed using the full process.",'-,4.7,258350,CentOS Stream Security update for kernel,3,3,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 18, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,257750685,srvunielk11v.czech.net,10.43.217.217,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feb9:9e3f,Refer to CentOS security advisory kernel for updates and patch information.(https://kojihub.stream.centos.org/koji/buildinfo?buildID=75129),"CH,Cloud Agent,All",No,No,'-,12,"Feb 18, 2025","Feb 17, 2025",CentOS,MEDIUM,High Lateral Movement,CentOS Stream 9,'-,'-,72,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",No,2,339,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-12797,"Issue summary: Clients using RFC7250 Raw Public Keys (RPKs) to authenticate a
server may fail to notice that the server was not authenticated, because
handshakes don't abort as expected when the SSL_VERIFY_PEER verification mode
is set.

Impact summary: TLS and DTLS connections using raw public keys may be
vulnerable to man-in-middle attacks when server authentication failure is not
detected by clients.

RPKs are disabled by default in both TLS clients and TLS servers.  The issue
only arises when TLS clients explicitly enable RPK use by the server, and the
server, likewise, enables sending of an RPK instead of an X.509 certificate
chain.  The affected clients are those that then rely on the handshake to
fail when the server's RPK fails to match one of the expected public keys,
by setting the verification mode to SSL_VERIFY_PEER.

Clients that enable server-side raw public keys can still find out that raw
public key verification failed by calling SSL_get_verify_result(), and those
that do, and take appropriate action, are not affected.  This issue was
introduced in the initial implementation of RPK support in OpenSSL 3.2.

CVE-2024-29018,"Moby is an open source container framework that is a key component of Docker Engine, Docker Desktop, and other distributions of container tooling or runtimes. Moby's networking implementation allows for many networks, each with their own IP address range and gateway, to be defined. This feature is frequently referred to as custom networks, as each network can have a different driver, set of parameters and thus behaviors. When creating a network, the `--internal` flag is used to designate a network as _internal_. The `internal` attribute in a docker-compose.yml file may also be used to mark a network _internal_, and other API clients may specify the `internal` parameter as well.

When containers with networking are created, they are assigned unique network interfaces and IP addresses. The host serves as a router for non-internal networks, with a gateway IP that provides SNAT/DNAT to/from container IPs.

Containers on an internal network may communicate between each other, but are precluded from communicating with any networks the host has access to (LAN or WAN) as no default route is configured, and firewall rules are set up to drop all outgoing traffic. Communication with the gateway IP address (and thus appropriately configured host services) is possible, and the host may communicate with any container IP directly.

In addition to configuring the Linux kernel's various networking features to enable container networking, `dockerd` directly provides some services to container networks. Principal among these is serving as a resolver, enabling service discovery, and resolution of names from an upstream resolver.

When a DNS request for a name that does not correspond to a container is received, the request is forwarded to the configured upstream resolver. This request is made from the container's network namespace: the level of access and routing of traffic is the same as if the request was made by the container itself.

As a consequence of this design, containers solely attached to an internal network will be unable to resolve names using the upstream resolver, as the container itself is unable to communicate with that nameserver. Only the names of containers also attached to the internal network are able to be resolved.

Many systems run a local forwarding DNS resolver. As the host and any containers have separate loopback devices, a consequence of the design described above is that containers are unable to resolve names from the host's configured resolver, as they cannot reach these addresses on the host loopback device. To bridge this gap, and to allow containers to properly resolve names even when a local forwarding resolver is used on a loopback address, `dockerd` detects this scenario and instead forward DNS requests from the host namework namespace. The loopback resolver then forwards the requests to its configured upstream resolvers, as expected.

Because `dockerd` forwards DNS requests to the host loopback device, bypassing the container network namespace's normal routing semantics entirely, internal networks can unexpectedly forward DNS requests to an external nameserver. By registering a domain for which they control the authoritative nameservers, an attacker could arrange for a compromised container to exfiltrate data by encoding it in DNS queries that will eventually be answered by their nameservers.

Docker Desktop is not affected, as Docker Desktop always runs an internal resolver on a RFC 1918 address.

Moby releases 26.0.0, 25.0.4, and 23.0.11 are patched to prevent forwarding any DNS requests from internal networks. As a workaround, run containers intended to be solely attached to internal networks with a custom upstream address, which will force all upstream DNS queries to be resolved from the container's network namespace.",'-,'-,6021664,Ubuntu Security Notification for Docker Vulnerabilities (USN-7161-2),5,5,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 19, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,131806557,ptdtc-sv-ai4med.portugal.pt,"10.200.8.46,172.17.0.1,172.18.0.1,172.24.0.1","fe80:0:0:0:42:23ff:febe:9aec,fe80:0:0:0:42:beff:fee5:7d48,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:a6c,fe80:0:0:0:1cb9:19ff:fe59:36b3,fe80:0:0:0:4404:63ff:fe72:308f,fe80:0:0:0:64f4:43ff:fe8e:d47f,fe80:0:0:0:68c2:12ff:fecc:a620,fe80:0:0:0:70c3:78ff:fe19:2dcd,fe80:0:0:0:8049:aff:feb9:8076,fe80:0:0:0:e484:43ff:fe1a:d417",Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7161-2 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7161-2),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT,Group-10",No,No,30,11,"Feb 19, 2025","Feb 18, 2025",Ubuntu,CRITICAL,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,Remote Code Execution,Privilege Escalation",Ubuntu Linux 20.04.6,'-,'-,65,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",No,2,135,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-41110,"Moby is an open-source project created by Docker for software containerization. A security vulnerability has been detected in certain versions of Docker Engine, which could allow an attacker to bypass authorization plugins (AuthZ) under specific circumstances. The base likelihood of this being exploited is low.

Using a specially-crafted API request, an Engine API client could make the daemon forward the request or response to an authorization plugin without the body. In certain circumstances, the authorization plugin may allow a request which it would have otherwise denied if the body had been forwarded to it.

A security issue was discovered In 2018, where an attacker could bypass AuthZ plugins using a specially crafted API request. This could lead to unauthorized actions, including privilege escalation. Although this issue was fixed in Docker Engine v18.09.1 in January 2019, the fix was not carried forward to later major versions, resulting in a regression. Anyone who depends on authorization plugins that introspect the request and/or response body to make access control decisions is potentially impacted.

Docker EE v19.03.x and all versions of Mirantis Container Runtime are not vulnerable.

docker-ce v27.1.1 containes patches to fix the vulnerability. Patches have also been merged into the master, 19.03, 20.0, 23.0, 24.0, 25.0, 26.0, and 26.1 release branches.
