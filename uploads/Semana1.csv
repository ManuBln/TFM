CVE-2024-47742,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

firmware_loader: Block path traversal

Most firmware names are hardcoded strings, or are constructed from fairly
constrained format strings where the dynamic parts are just some hex
numbers or such.

However, there are a couple codepaths in the kernel where firmware file
names contain string components that are passed through from a device or
semi-privileged userspace; the ones I could find (not counting interfaces
that require root privileges) are:

 - lpfc_sli4_request_firmware_update() seems to construct the firmware
   filename from ""ModelName"", a string that was previously parsed out of
   some descriptor (""Vital Product Data"") in lpfc_fill_vpd()
 - nfp_net_fw_find() seems to construct a firmware filename from a model
   name coming from nfp_hwinfo_lookup(pf->hwinfo, ""nffw.partno""), which I
   think parses some descriptor that was read from the device.
   (But this case likely isn't exploitable because the format string looks
   like ""netronome/nic_%s"", and there shouldn't be any *folders* starting
   with ""netronome/nic_"". The previous case was different because there,
   the ""%s"" is *at the start* of the format string.)
 - module_flash_fw_schedule() is reachable from the
   ETHTOOL_MSG_MODULE_FW_FLASH_ACT netlink command, which is marked as
   GENL_UNS_ADMIN_PERM (meaning CAP_NET_ADMIN inside a user namespace is
   enough to pass the privilege check), and takes a userspace-provided
   firmware name.
   (But I think to reach this case, you need to have CAP_NET_ADMIN over a
   network namespace that a special kind of ethernet device is mapped into,
   so I think this is not a viable attack path in practice.)

Fix it by rejecting any firmware names containing "".."" path components.

For what it's worth, I went looking and haven't found any USB device
drivers that use the firmware loader dangerously.",'-,7.8,358475,Amazon Linux Security Advisory for kernel : ALAS2-2025-2745,4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 5, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,197494362,ptaws-sv-wspp1.portugal.pt,"10.64.192.14,172.17.0.1,172.18.0.1,172.19.0.1,172.20.0.1,172.21.0.1,172.22.0.1","fe80:0:0:0:42:6ff:fe48:1eb6,fe80:0:0:0:42:18ff:fe12:3133,fe80:0:0:0:42:77ff:fef4:172d,fe80:0:0:0:42:98ff:fe93:fa0a,fe80:0:0:0:42:9eff:fed8:34b6,fe80:0:0:0:6b:4dff:fe34:7ba,fe80:0:0:0:442:f1ff:fe67:bf96,fe80:0:0:0:8c0:c5ff:febc:4fb,fe80:0:0:0:c11:71ff:fe17:f3d9,fe80:0:0:0:18ac:56ff:fed3:f521,fe80:0:0:0:1c57:35ff:fe50:ee44,fe80:0:0:0:1c7c:aaff:fe8e:8a02,fe80:0:0:0:1cca:18ff:fe5f:7ed7,fe80:0:0:0:2c92:f8ff:fe9e:344,fe80:0:0:0:5009:6ff:fe8b:a250,fe80:0:0:0:505a:cdff:fe18:4fee,fe80:0:0:0:5817:49ff:fe5f:d042,fe80:0:0:0:6ccf:9aff:fe18:90bc,fe80:0:0:0:7091:94ff:fe87:1d16,fe80:0:0:0:8c6a:2ff:fee9:5f5d,fe80:0:0:0:8cdd:c8ff:fee4:691e,fe80:0:0:0:905e:75ff:fe54:edd3,fe80:0:0:0:9072:3fff:fe3d:5ee1,fe80:0:0:0:949b:b4ff:fee5:7d15,fe80:0:0:0:94f6:cdff:fe1e:2c25,fe80:0:0:0:a8e4:4aff:fe9a:7b42,fe80:0:0:0:cccf:b1ff:fee8:25a2,fe80:0:0:0:d831:87ff:fe7a:3f1f,fe80:0:0:0:ec66:93ff:fe67:3c76,fe80:0:0:0:fc8f:84ff:fe44:98d6","Please refer to Amazon advisory: ALAS2-2025-2745 for affected packages and patching details, or update with your package manager.(https://alas.aws.amazon.com/AL2/ALAS-2025-2745.html)","PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,35,25,"Feb 5, 2025","Jan 30, 2025",Amazon Linux,HIGH,High Lateral Movement,Amazon Linux 2,'-,'-,56,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a securitybreach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,50,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-50067,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

uprobe: avoid out-of-bounds memory access of fetching args

Uprobe needs to fetch args into a percpu buffer, and then copy to ring
buffer to avoid non-atomic context problem.

Sometimes user-space strings, arrays can be very large, but the size of
percpu buffer is only page size. And store_trace_args() won't check
whether these data exceeds a single page or not, caused out-of-bounds
memory access.

It could be reproduced by following steps:
1. build kernel with CONFIG_KASAN enabled
2. save follow program as test.c

```
\#include <stdio.h>
\#include <stdlib.h>
\#include <string.h>

// If string length large than MAX_STRING_SIZE, the fetch_store_strlen()
// will return 0, cause __get_data_size() return shorter size, and
// store_trace_args() will not trigger out-of-bounds access.
// So make string length less than 4096.
\#define STRLEN 4093

void generate_string(char *str, int n)
{
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i < n; ++i)
    {
        char c = i % 26 + 'a';
        str[i] = c;
    }
    str[n-1] = '\0';
}

void print_string(char *str)
{
    printf(""%s\n"", str);
}

int main()
{
    char tmp[STRLEN];

    generate_string(tmp, STRLEN);
    print_string(tmp);

    return 0;
}
```
3. compile program
`gcc -o test test.c`

4. get the offset of `print_string()`
```
objdump -t test | grep -w print_string
0000000000401199 g     F .text  000000000000001b              print_string
```

5. configure uprobe with offset 0x1199
```
off=0x1199

cd /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/
echo ""p /root/test:${off} arg1=+0(%di):ustring arg2=\$comm arg3=+0(%di):ustring""
 > uprobe_events
echo 1 > events/uprobes/enable
echo 1 > tracing_on
```

6. run `test`, and kasan will report error.

CVE-2024-50230,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nilfs2: fix kernel bug due to missing clearing of checked flag

Syzbot reported that in directory operations after nilfs2 detects
filesystem corruption and degrades to read-only,
__block_write_begin_int(), which is called to prepare block writes, may
fail the BUG_ON check for accesses exceeding the folio/page size,
triggering a kernel bug.

This was found to be because the ""checked"" flag of a page/folio was not
cleared when it was discarded by nilfs2's own routine, which causes the
sanity check of directory entries to be skipped when the directory
page/folio is reloaded.  So, fix that.

This was necessary when the use of nilfs2's own page discard routine was
applied to more than just metadata files.",'-,7.8,358475,Amazon Linux Security Advisory for kernel : ALAS2-2025-2745,4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 5, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,197494362,ptaws-sv-wspp1.portugal.pt,"10.64.192.14,172.17.0.1,172.18.0.1,172.19.0.1,172.20.0.1,172.21.0.1,172.22.0.1","fe80:0:0:0:42:6ff:fe48:1eb6,fe80:0:0:0:42:18ff:fe12:3133,fe80:0:0:0:42:77ff:fef4:172d,fe80:0:0:0:42:98ff:fe93:fa0a,fe80:0:0:0:42:9eff:fed8:34b6,fe80:0:0:0:6b:4dff:fe34:7ba,fe80:0:0:0:442:f1ff:fe67:bf96,fe80:0:0:0:8c0:c5ff:febc:4fb,fe80:0:0:0:c11:71ff:fe17:f3d9,fe80:0:0:0:18ac:56ff:fed3:f521,fe80:0:0:0:1c57:35ff:fe50:ee44,fe80:0:0:0:1c7c:aaff:fe8e:8a02,fe80:0:0:0:1cca:18ff:fe5f:7ed7,fe80:0:0:0:2c92:f8ff:fe9e:344,fe80:0:0:0:5009:6ff:fe8b:a250,fe80:0:0:0:505a:cdff:fe18:4fee,fe80:0:0:0:5817:49ff:fe5f:d042,fe80:0:0:0:6ccf:9aff:fe18:90bc,fe80:0:0:0:7091:94ff:fe87:1d16,fe80:0:0:0:8c6a:2ff:fee9:5f5d,fe80:0:0:0:8cdd:c8ff:fee4:691e,fe80:0:0:0:905e:75ff:fe54:edd3,fe80:0:0:0:9072:3fff:fe3d:5ee1,fe80:0:0:0:949b:b4ff:fee5:7d15,fe80:0:0:0:94f6:cdff:fe1e:2c25,fe80:0:0:0:a8e4:4aff:fe9a:7b42,fe80:0:0:0:cccf:b1ff:fee8:25a2,fe80:0:0:0:d831:87ff:fe7a:3f1f,fe80:0:0:0:ec66:93ff:fe67:3c76,fe80:0:0:0:fc8f:84ff:fe44:98d6","Please refer to Amazon advisory: ALAS2-2025-2745 for affected packages and patching details, or update with your package manager.(https://alas.aws.amazon.com/AL2/ALAS-2025-2745.html)","PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,35,25,"Feb 5, 2025","Jan 30, 2025",Amazon Linux,HIGH,High Lateral Movement,Amazon Linux 2,'-,'-,56,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a securitybreach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,50,,"#table cols=""3""

ext4_split_extent_at

  ext4_ext_insert_extent(ppath)
    ext4_ext_create_new_leaf(ppath)
      ext4_find_extent(orig_path)

  a. If err is -ENOMEM:
  ext4_ext_dirty(path + path->p_depth)
  // path use-after-free !!!
  b. If err is -EIO and we have EXT_DEBUG defined:
  ext4_ext_show_leaf(path)
    eh = path[depth].p_hdr
    // path also use-after-free !!!

So when trying to zeroout or fix the extent length, call ext4_find_extent()
to update the path.

In addition we use *ppath directly as an ext4_ext_show_leaf() input to
avoid possible use-after-free when EXT_DEBUG is defined, and to avoid
unnecessary path updates.",'-,7.8,358475,Amazon Linux Security Advisory for kernel : ALAS2-2025-2745,4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 5, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,197494362,ptaws-sv-wspp1.portugal.pt,"10.64.192.14,172.17.0.1,172.18.0.1,172.19.0.1,172.20.0.1,172.21.0.1,172.22.0.1","fe80:0:0:0:42:6ff:fe48:1eb6,fe80:0:0:0:42:18ff:fe12:3133,fe80:0:0:0:42:77ff:fef4:172d,fe80:0:0:0:42:98ff:fe93:fa0a,fe80:0:0:0:42:9eff:fed8:34b6,fe80:0:0:0:6b:4dff:fe34:7ba,fe80:0:0:0:442:f1ff:fe67:bf96,fe80:0:0:0:8c0:c5ff:febc:4fb,fe80:0:0:0:c11:71ff:fe17:f3d9,fe80:0:0:0:18ac:56ff:fed3:f521,fe80:0:0:0:1c57:35ff:fe50:ee44,fe80:0:0:0:1c7c:aaff:fe8e:8a02,fe80:0:0:0:1cca:18ff:fe5f:7ed7,fe80:0:0:0:2c92:f8ff:fe9e:344,fe80:0:0:0:5009:6ff:fe8b:a250,fe80:0:0:0:505a:cdff:fe18:4fee,fe80:0:0:0:5817:49ff:fe5f:d042,fe80:0:0:0:6ccf:9aff:fe18:90bc,fe80:0:0:0:7091:94ff:fe87:1d16,fe80:0:0:0:8c6a:2ff:fee9:5f5d,fe80:0:0:0:8cdd:c8ff:fee4:691e,fe80:0:0:0:905e:75ff:fe54:edd3,fe80:0:0:0:9072:3fff:fe3d:5ee1,fe80:0:0:0:949b:b4ff:fee5:7d15,fe80:0:0:0:94f6:cdff:fe1e:2c25,fe80:0:0:0:a8e4:4aff:fe9a:7b42,fe80:0:0:0:cccf:b1ff:fee8:25a2,fe80:0:0:0:d831:87ff:fe7a:3f1f,fe80:0:0:0:ec66:93ff:fe67:3c76,fe80:0:0:0:fc8f:84ff:fe44:98d6","Please refer to Amazon advisory: ALAS2-2025-2745 for affected packages and patching details, or update with your package manager.(https://alas.aws.amazon.com/AL2/ALAS-2025-2745.html)","PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,35,25,"Feb 5, 2025","Jan 30, 2025",Amazon Linux,HIGH,High Lateral Movement,Amazon Linux 2,'-,'-,56,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a securitybreach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,50,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-50067,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

uprobe: avoid out-of-bounds memory access of fetching args

Uprobe needs to fetch args into a percpu buffer, and then copy to ring
buffer to avoid non-atomic context problem.

Sometimes user-space strings, arrays can be very large, but the size of
percpu buffer is only page size. And store_trace_args() won't check
whether these data exceeds a single page or not, caused out-of-bounds
memory access.

It could be reproduced by following steps:
1. build kernel with CONFIG_KASAN enabled
2. save follow program as test.c

```
\#include <stdio.h>
\#include <stdlib.h>
\#include <string.h>

// If string length large than MAX_STRING_SIZE, the fetch_store_strlen()
// will return 0, cause __get_data_size() return shorter size, and
// store_trace_args() will not trigger out-of-bounds access.
// So make string length less than 4096.
\#define STRLEN 4093

void generate_string(char *str, int n)
{
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i < n; ++i)
    {
        char c = i % 26 + 'a';
        str[i] = c;
    }
    str[n-1] = '\0';
}

    printf(""%s\n"", str);
}

int main()
{
    char tmp[STRLEN];

    generate_string(tmp, STRLEN);
    print_string(tmp);

    return 0;
}
```
3. compile program
`gcc -o test test.c`

4. get the offset of `print_string()`
```
objdump -t test | grep -w print_string
0000000000401199 g     F .text  000000000000001b              print_string
```

5. configure uprobe with offset 0x1199
```
off=0x1199

cd /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/
echo ""p /root/test:${off} arg1=+0(%di):ustring arg2=\$comm arg3=+0(%di):ustring""
 > uprobe_events
echo 1 > events/uprobes/enable
echo 1 > tracing_on
```

6. run `test`, and kasan will report error.

CVE-2024-47742,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

firmware_loader: Block path traversal

Most firmware names are hardcoded strings, or are constructed from fairly
constrained format strings where the dynamic parts are just some hex
numbers or such.

However, there are a couple codepaths in the kernel where firmware file
names contain string components that are passed through from a device or
semi-privileged userspace; the ones I could find (not counting interfaces
that require root privileges) are:

 - lpfc_sli4_request_firmware_update() seems to construct the firmware
   filename from ""ModelName"", a string that was previously parsed out of
   some descriptor (""Vital Product Data"") in lpfc_fill_vpd()
 - nfp_net_fw_find() seems to construct a firmware filename from a model
   name coming from nfp_hwinfo_lookup(pf->hwinfo, ""nffw.partno""), which I
   think parses some descriptor that was read from the device.
   (But this case likely isn't exploitable because the format string looks
   like ""netronome/nic_%s"", and there shouldn't be any *folders* starting
   with ""netronome/nic_"". The previous case was different because there,
   the ""%s"" is *at the start* of the format string.)
 - module_flash_fw_schedule() is reachable from the
   ETHTOOL_MSG_MODULE_FW_FLASH_ACT netlink command, which is marked as
   GENL_UNS_ADMIN_PERM (meaning CAP_NET_ADMIN inside a user namespace is
   enough to pass the privilege check), and takes a userspace-provided
   firmware name.
   (But I think to reach this case, you need to have CAP_NET_ADMIN over a
   network namespace that a special kind of ethernet device is mapped into,
   so I think this is not a viable attack path in practice.)

Fix it by rejecting any firmware names containing "".."" path components.

For what it's worth, I went looking and haven't found any USB device
drivers that use the firmware loader dangerously.",'-,7.8,358475,Amazon Linux Security Advisory for kernel : ALAS2-2025-2745,4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 5, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,197492748,ptaws-sv-wsapi1.portugal.pt,"10.64.192.11,172.17.0.1,172.18.0.1,172.20.0.1,172.23.0.1","fe80:0:0:0:42:5cff:fe0b:6563,fe80:0:0:0:42:62ff:fe6b:85d,fe80:0:0:0:42:70ff:fe50:b89,fe80:0:0:0:bf:c9ff:fef8:b5fb,fe80:0:0:0:835:95ff:fe9e:cce3,fe80:0:0:0:1423:d3ff:fe75:aa86,fe80:0:0:0:14ad:e9ff:fe21:235e,fe80:0:0:0:18ee:5eff:fe0f:b382,fe80:0:0:0:2808:2cff:feb2:734c,fe80:0:0:0:5434:85ff:fedf:1d21,fe80:0:0:0:5c7c:e9ff:fee2:34fa,fe80:0:0:0:6c37:85ff:fe4d:3bc,fe80:0:0:0:745c:daff:fede:3496,fe80:0:0:0:903f:82ff:fe91:f45f,fe80:0:0:0:a87b:79ff:fe3a:34e9,fe80:0:0:0:bcd1:91ff:fe13:bef6,fe80:0:0:0:d0dc:93ff:fef9:fc5c,fe80:0:0:0:f00a:96ff:fe3c:1891,fe80:0:0:0:f069:94ff:fe12:c32","Please refer to Amazon advisory: ALAS2-2025-2745 for affected packages and patching details, or update with your package manager.(https://alas.aws.amazon.com/AL2/ALAS-2025-2745.html)","PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,35,25,"Feb 5, 2025","Jan 30, 2025",Amazon Linux,HIGH,High Lateral Movement,Amazon Linux 2,'-,'-,143,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a securitybreach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,51,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-50067,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

uprobe: avoid out-of-bounds memory access of fetching args

Uprobe needs to fetch args into a percpu buffer, and then copy to ring
buffer to avoid non-atomic context problem.

Sometimes user-space strings, arrays can be very large, but the size of
percpu buffer is only page size. And store_trace_args() won't check
whether these data exceeds a single page or not, caused out-of-bounds
memory access.

It could be reproduced by following steps:
1. build kernel with CONFIG_KASAN enabled
2. save follow program as test.c

```
\#include <stdio.h>
\#include <stdlib.h>
\#include <string.h>

// If string length large than MAX_STRING_SIZE, the fetch_store_strlen()
// will return 0, cause __get_data_size() return shorter size, and
// store_trace_args() will not trigger out-of-bounds access.
// So make string length less than 4096.
\#define STRLEN 4093

void generate_string(char *str, int n)
{
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i < n; ++i)
    {
        char c = i % 26 + 'a';
        str[i] = c;
    }
    str[n-1] = '\0';
}

void print_string(char *str)
{
    printf(""%s\n"", str);
}

int main()
{
    char tmp[STRLEN];

    generate_string(tmp, STRLEN);
    print_string(tmp);

    return 0;
}
```
3. compile program
`gcc -o test test.c`

4. get the offset of `print_string()`
```
objdump -t test | grep -w print_string
0000000000401199 g     F .text  000000000000001b              print_string
```

5. configure uprobe with offset 0x1199
```
off=0x1199

cd /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/
echo ""p /root/test:${off} arg1=+0(%di):ustring arg2=\$comm arg3=+0(%di):ustring""
 > uprobe_events
echo 1 > events/uprobes/enable
echo 1 > tracing_on
```

6. run `test`, and kasan will report error.

CVE-2024-50230,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nilfs2: fix kernel bug due to missing clearing of checked flag

Syzbot reported that in directory operations after nilfs2 detects
filesystem corruption and degrades to read-only,
__block_write_begin_int(), which is called to prepare block writes, may
fail the BUG_ON check for accesses exceeding the folio/page size,
triggering a kernel bug.

This was found to be because the ""checked"" flag of a page/folio was not
cleared when it was discarded by nilfs2's own routine, which causes the
sanity check of directory entries to be skipped when the directory
page/folio is reloaded.  So, fix that.

This was necessary when the use of nilfs2's own page discard routine was
applied to more than just metadata files.",'-,7.8,358475,Amazon Linux Security Advisory for kernel : ALAS2-2025-2745,4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 5, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,197492748,ptaws-sv-wsapi1.portugal.pt,"10.64.192.11,172.17.0.1,172.18.0.1,172.20.0.1,172.23.0.1","fe80:0:0:0:42:5cff:fe0b:6563,fe80:0:0:0:42:62ff:fe6b:85d,fe80:0:0:0:42:70ff:fe50:b89,fe80:0:0:0:bf:c9ff:fef8:b5fb,fe80:0:0:0:835:95ff:fe9e:cce3,fe80:0:0:0:1423:d3ff:fe75:aa86,fe80:0:0:0:14ad:e9ff:fe21:235e,fe80:0:0:0:18ee:5eff:fe0f:b382,fe80:0:0:0:2808:2cff:feb2:734c,fe80:0:0:0:5434:85ff:fedf:1d21,fe80:0:0:0:5c7c:e9ff:fee2:34fa,fe80:0:0:0:6c37:85ff:fe4d:3bc,fe80:0:0:0:745c:daff:fede:3496,fe80:0:0:0:903f:82ff:fe91:f45f,fe80:0:0:0:a87b:79ff:fe3a:34e9,fe80:0:0:0:bcd1:91ff:fe13:bef6,fe80:0:0:0:d0dc:93ff:fef9:fc5c,fe80:0:0:0:f00a:96ff:fe3c:1891,fe80:0:0:0:f069:94ff:fe12:c32","Please refer to Amazon advisory: ALAS2-2025-2745 for affected packages and patching details, or update with your package manager.(https://alas.aws.amazon.com/AL2/ALAS-2025-2745.html)","PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,35,25,"Feb 5, 2025","Jan 30, 2025",Amazon Linux,HIGH,High Lateral Movement,Amazon Linux 2,'-,'-,143,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a securitybreach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,51,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-47606,"GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. An integer underflow has been detected in the function qtdemux_parse_theora_extension within qtdemux.c. The vulnerability occurs due to an underflow of the gint size variable, which causes size to hold a large unintended value when cast to an unsigned integer. This 32-bit negative value is then cast to a 64-bit unsigned integer (0xfffffffffffffffa) in a subsequent call to gst_buffer_new_and_alloc. The function gst_buffer_new_allocate then attempts to allocate memory, eventually calling _sysmem_new_block. The function _sysmem_new_block adds alignment and header size to the (unsigned) size, causing the overflow of the 'slice_size' variable. As a result, only 0x89 bytes are allocated, despite the large input size. When the following memcpy call occurs in gst_buffer_fill, the data from the input file will overwrite the content of the GstMapInfo info structure. Finally, during the call to gst_memory_unmap, the overwritten memory may cause a function pointer hijack, as the mem->allocator->mem_unmap_full function is called with a corrupted pointer. This function pointer overwrite could allow an attacker to alter the execution flow of the program, leading to arbitrary code execution.

CVE-2024-47540,"GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. An uninitialized stack variable vulnerability has been identified in the gst_matroska_demux_add_wvpk_header function within matroska-demux.c. When size < 4, the program calls gst_buffer_unmap with an uninitialized map variable. Then, in the gst_memory_unmap function, the program will attempt to unmap the buffer using the uninitialized map variable, causing a function pointer hijack, as it will jump to mem->allocator->mem_unmap_full or mem->allocator->mem_unmap.

CVE-2024-36899,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

gpiolib: cdev: Fix use after free in lineinfo_changed_notify

The use-after-free issue occurs as follows: when the GPIO chip device file
is being closed by invoking gpio_chrdev_release(), watched_lines is freed
by bitmap_free(), but the unregistration of lineinfo_changed_nb notifier
chain failed due to waiting write rwsem. Additionally, one of the GPIO
chip's lines is also in the release process and holds the notifier chain's
read rwsem. Consequently, a race condition leads to the use-after-free of
watched_lines.

Here is the typical stack when issue happened:

[free]
gpio_chrdev_release()
  --> bitmap_free(cdev->watched_lines)                  <-- freed
  --> blocking_notifier_chain_unregister()
    --> down_write(&nh->rwsem)                          <-- waiting rwsem
          --> __down_write_common()
            --> rwsem_down_write_slowpath()
                  --> schedule_preempt_disabled()
                    --> schedule()

[use]
st54spi_gpio_dev_release()
  --> gpio_free()
    --> gpiod_free()
      --> gpiod_free_commit()
        --> gpiod_line_state_notify()
          --> blocking_notifier_call_chain()
            --> down_read(&nh->rwsem);                  <-- held rwsem
            --> notifier_call_chain()
              --> lineinfo_changed_notify()
                --> test_bit(xxxx, cdev->watched_lines) <-- use after free

The side effect of the use-after-free issue is that a GPIO line event is
being generated for userspace where it shouldn't. However, since the chrdev
is being closed, userspace won't have the chance to read that event anyway.

To fix the issue, call the bitmap_free() function after the unregistration
of lineinfo_changed_nb notifier chain.",'-,7,358510,Amazon Linux Security Advisory for kernel : ALAS2023-2025-823,4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 7, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,197473531,ptaws-sv-mdprx1.portugal.pt,10.64.192.189,fe80:0:0:0:884:caff:fe9e:531d,"Please refer to Amazon advisory: ALAS2023-2025-823 for affected packages and patching details, or update with your package manager.(https://alas.aws.amazon.com/AL2023/ALAS-2025-823.html)","PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,35,24,"Feb 6, 2025","Jan 30, 2025",Amazon Linux,HIGH,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit",Amazon Linux 2023.6.20250218,'-,'-,128,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a securitybreach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,14,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-50164,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Fix overloading of MEM_UNINIT's meaning

Lonial reported an issue in the BPF verifier where check_mem_size_reg()
has the following code:

    if (!tnum_is_const(reg->var_off))
        /* For unprivileged variable accesses, disable raw
         * mode so that the program is required to
         * initialize all the memory that the helper could
         * just partially fill up.
         */
         meta = NULL;

This means that writes are not checked when the register containing the
size of the passed buffer has not a fixed size. Through this bug, a BPF
program can write to a map which is marked as read-only, for example,
.rodata global maps.

The problem is that MEM_UNINIT's initial meaning that ""the passed buffer
to the BPF helper does not need to be initialized"" which was added back
in commit 435faee1aae9 (""bpf, verifier: add ARG_PTR_TO_RAW_STACK type"")
got overloaded over time with ""the passed buffer is being written to"".

The problem however is that checks such as the above which were added later
via 06c1c049721a (""bpf: allow helpers access to variable memory"") set meta
to NULL in order force the user to always initialize the passed buffer to
the helper. Due to the current double meaning of MEM_UNINIT, this bypasses
verifier write checks to the memory (not boundary checks though) and only
assumes the latter memory is read instead.

Fix this by reverting MEM_UNINIT back to its original meaning, and having
MEM_WRITE as an annotation to BPF helpers in order to then trigger the
BPF verifier checks for writing to memory.

Some notes: check_arg_pair_ok() ensures that for ARG_CONST_SIZE{,_OR_ZERO}
we can access fn->arg_type[arg - 1] since it must contain a preceding
ARG_PTR_TO_MEM. For check_mem_reg() the meta argument can be removed
altogether since we do check both BPF_READ and BPF_WRITE. Same for the
equivalent check_kfunc_mem_size_reg().",'-,7.1,358510,Amazon Linux Security Advisory for kernel : ALAS2023-2025-823,4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 7, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,197473531,ptaws-sv-mdprx1.portugal.pt,10.64.192.189,fe80:0:0:0:884:caff:fe9e:531d,"Please refer to Amazon advisory: ALAS2023-2025-823 for affected packages and patching details, or update with your package manager.(https://alas.aws.amazon.com/AL2023/ALAS-2025-823.html)","PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,35,24,"Feb 6, 2025","Jan 30, 2025",Amazon Linux,HIGH,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit",Amazon Linux 2023.6.20250218,'-,'-,128,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a securitybreach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,14,,"#table cols=""3""

dm array: fix releasing a faulty array block twice in dm_array_cursor_end

When dm_bm_read_lock() fails due to locking or checksum errors, it
releases the faulty block implicitly while leaving an invalid output
pointer behind. The caller of dm_bm_read_lock() should not operate on
this invalid dm_block pointer, or it will lead to undefined result.
For example, the dm_array_cursor incorrectly caches the invalid pointer
on reading a faulty array block, causing a double release in
dm_array_cursor_end(), then hitting the BUG_ON in dm-bufio cache_put().

Reproduce steps:

1. initialize a cache device

dmsetup create cmeta --table ""0 8192 linear /dev/sdc 0""
dmsetup create cdata --table ""0 65536 linear /dev/sdc 8192""
dmsetup create corig --table ""0 524288 linear /dev/sdc $262144""

dmsetup create cache --table ""0 524288 cache /dev/mapper/cmeta \
/dev/mapper/cdata /dev/mapper/corig 128 2 metadata2 writethrough smq 0""

2. wipe the second array block offline

dmsteup remove cache cmeta cdata corig
mapping_root=$(dd if=/dev/sdc bs=1c count=8 skip=192 \

2>/dev/null | hexdump -e '1/8 ""%u\n""')
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdc bs=4k count=1 seek=$ablock

3. try reopen the cache device

dmsetup create cmeta --table ""0 8192 linear /dev/sdc 0""
dmsetup create cdata --table ""0 65536 linear /dev/sdc 8192""
dmsetup create corig --table ""0 524288 linear /dev/sdc $262144""

after the domain is freed, causing a use-after-free condition.

This issue really shows up when multiple VFs from different PFs
passed through to a single user-space process via vfio-pci. In such
cases, the kernel may crash with kernel messages like:

CVE-2024-56568,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommu/arm-smmu: Defer probe of clients after smmu device bound

Null pointer dereference occurs due to a race between smmu
driver probe and client driver probe, when of_dma_configure()
for client is called after the iommu_device_register() for smmu driver
probe has executed but before the driver_bound() for smmu driver
has been called.

Following is how the race occurs:

T1:Smmu device probe		T2: Client device probe

really_probe()
arm_smmu_device_probe()
iommu_device_register()
					really_probe()
					platform_dma_configure()
					of_dma_configure()
					of_dma_configure_id()
					of_iommu_configure()

						    /* null ptr
						       assigned to smmu */
					/* null ptr dereference
					   while smmu->streamid_mask */
driver_bound()
	klist_add_tail()

When this null smmu pointer is dereferenced later in
arm_smmu_probe_device, the device crashes.

Fix this by deferring the probe of the client device
until the smmu device has bound to the arm smmu driver.

CVE-2024-56668,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommu/vt-d: Fix qi_batch NULL pointer with nested parent domain

The qi_batch is allocated when assigning cache tag for a domain. While
for nested parent domain, it is missed. Hence, when trying to map pages
to the nested parent, NULL dereference occurred. Also, there is potential
memleak since there is no lock around domain->qi_batch allocation.

To solve it, add a helper for qi_batch allocation, and call it in both
the __cache_tag_assign_domain() and __cache_tag_assign_parent_domain().

recognizes the device as it has already been removed and we end up with
a NULL domain pointer and UAF. This is exactly the case referred to in
the second comment in __iommu_device_set_domain() and just as stated
there if we can instead attach the blocking domain the UAF is prevented

CVE-2024-50271,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

signal: restore the override_rlimit logic

Prior to commit d64696905554 (""Reimplement RLIMIT_SIGPENDING on top of
ucounts"") UCOUNT_RLIMIT_SIGPENDING rlimit was not enforced for a class of
signals.  However now it's enforced unconditionally, even if
override_rlimit is set.  This behavior change caused production issues.  

For example, if the limit is reached and a process receives a SIGSEGV
signal, sigqueue_alloc fails to allocate the necessary resources for the
signal delivery, preventing the signal from being delivered with siginfo. 
This prevents the process from correctly identifying the fault address and
handling the error.  From the user-space perspective, applications are
unaware that the limit has been reached and that the siginfo is
effectively 'corrupted'.  This can lead to unpredictable behavior and
crashes, as we observed with java applications.

Fix this by passing override_rlimit into inc_rlimit_get_ucounts() and skip
the comparison to max there if override_rlimit is set.  This effectively
restores the old behavior.",'-,5.5,258311,CentOS Stream Security update for kernel,4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 5, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,149342014,srvdmzcdi16v.czech.ch,10.43.225.218,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feb9:943b,Refer to CentOS security advisory kernel for updates and patch information.(https://kojihub.stream.centos.org/koji/buildinfo?buildID=74602),"CH,Cloud Agent,All",No,No,'-,25,"Feb 5, 2025","Feb 4, 2025",CentOS,HIGH,High Lateral Movement,CentOS Stream 9,'-,'-,144,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",No,2,340,,"#table cols=""3""

net: usb: lan78xx: Fix double free issue with interrupt buffer allocation

implicitly through `usb_free_urb(dev->urb_intr)` with the

CVE-2024-43882,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

exec: Fix ToCToU between perm check and set-uid/gid usage

When opening a file for exec via do_filp_open(), permission checking is
done against the file's metadata at that moment, and on success, a file
pointer is passed back. Much later in the execve() code path, the file
metadata (specifically mode, uid, and gid) is used to determine if/how
to set the uid and gid. However, those values may have changed since the
permissions check, meaning the execution may gain unintended privileges.

For example, if a file could change permissions from executable and not
set-id:

---------x 1 root root 16048 Aug  7 13:16 target

to set-id and non-executable:

---S------ 1 root root 16048 Aug  7 13:16 target

it is possible to gain root privileges when execution should have been
disallowed.

While this race condition is rare in real-world scenarios, it has been
observed (and proven exploitable) when package managers are updating
the setuid bits of installed programs. Such files start with being
world-executable but then are adjusted to be group-exec with a set-uid
bit. For example, ""chmod o-x,u+s target"" makes ""target"" executable only
by uid ""root"" and gid ""cdrom"", while also becoming setuid-root:

-rwxr-xr-x 1 root cdrom 16048 Aug  7 13:16 target

becomes:

-rwsr-xr-- 1 root cdrom 16048 Aug  7 13:16 target

But racing the chmod means users without group ""cdrom"" membership can
get the permission to execute ""target"" just before the chmod, and when
the chmod finishes, the exec reaches brpm_fill_uid(), and performs the
setuid to root, violating the expressed authorization of ""only cdrom
group members can setuid to root"".

Re-check that we still have execute permissions in case the metadata
has changed. It would be better to keep a copy from the perm-check time,
but until we can do that refactoring, the least-bad option is to do a
full inode_permission() call (under inode lock). It is understood that
this is safe against dead-locks, but hardly optimal.",'-,7,258311,CentOS Stream Security update for kernel,4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 5, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,149342014,srvdmzcdi16v.czech.ch,10.43.225.218,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feb9:943b,Refer to CentOS security advisory kernel for updates and patch information.(https://kojihub.stream.centos.org/koji/buildinfo?buildID=74602),"CH,Cloud Agent,All",No,No,35,25,"Feb 5, 2025","Feb 4, 2025",CentOS,HIGH,High Lateral Movement,CentOS Stream 9,'-,'-,144,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",No,2,340,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-53142,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

initramfs: avoid filename buffer overrun

The initramfs filename field is defined in
Documentation/driver-api/early-userspace/buffer-format.rst as:

 37 cpio_file := ALGN(4) + cpio_header + filename + ""\0"" + ALGN(4) + data
...
 55 ============= ================== =========================
 56 Field name    Field size         Meaning
 57 ============= ================== =========================
...
 70 c_namesize    8 bytes            Length of filename, including final \0

When extracting an initramfs cpio archive, the kernel's do_name() path
handler assumes a zero-terminated path at @collected, passing it
directly to filp_open() / init_mkdir() / init_mknod().

If a specially crafted cpio entry carries a non-zero-terminated filename
and is followed by uninitialized memory, then a file may be created with
trailing characters that represent the uninitialized memory. The ability
to create an initramfs entry would imply already having full control of
the system, so the buffer overrun shouldn't be considered a security
vulnerability.

Append the output of the following bash script to an existing initramfs
and observe any created /initramfs_test_fname_overrunAA* path. E.g.
  ./reproducer.sh | gzip >> /myinitramfs

It's easiest to observe non-zero uninitialized memory when the output is
gzipped, as it'll overflow the heap allocated @out_buf in __gunzip(),
rather than the initrd_start+initrd_size block.

CVE-2024-56779,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nfsd: fix nfs4_openowner leak when concurrent nfsd4_open occur

The action force umount(umount -f) will attempt to kill all rpc_task even
umount operation may ultimately fail if some files remain open.
Consequently, if an action attempts to open a file, it can potentially
send two rpc_task to nfs server.

While processing an open request, nfsd will first attempt to find or
allocate an nfs4_openowner. If it finds an nfs4_openowner that is not
marked as NFS4_OO_CONFIRMED, this nfs4_openowner will released. Since
two rpc_task can attempt to open the same file simultaneously from the
client to server, and because two instances of nfsd can run
concurrently, this situation can lead to lots of memory leak.
Additionally, when we echo 0 to /proc/fs/nfsd/threads, warning will be
triggered.

CVE-2024-53142,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

initramfs: avoid filename buffer overrun

The initramfs filename field is defined in
Documentation/driver-api/early-userspace/buffer-format.rst as:

 37 cpio_file := ALGN(4) + cpio_header + filename + ""\0"" + ALGN(4) + data
...
 55 ============= ================== =========================
 56 Field name    Field size         Meaning
 57 ============= ================== =========================
...
 70 c_namesize    8 bytes            Length of filename, including final \0

When extracting an initramfs cpio archive, the kernel's do_name() path
handler assumes a zero-terminated path at @collected, passing it
directly to filp_open() / init_mkdir() / init_mknod().

If a specially crafted cpio entry carries a non-zero-terminated filename
and is followed by uninitialized memory, then a file may be created with
trailing characters that represent the uninitialized memory. The ability
to create an initramfs entry would imply already having full control of
the system, so the buffer overrun shouldn't be considered a security
vulnerability.

Append the output of the following bash script to an existing initramfs
and observe any created /initramfs_test_fname_overrunAA* path. E.g.
  ./reproducer.sh | gzip >> /myinitramfs

It's easiest to observe non-zero uninitialized memory when the output is
gzipped, as it'll overflow the heap allocated @out_buf in __gunzip(),
rather than the initrd_start+initrd_size block.

CVE-2024-56779,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nfsd: fix nfs4_openowner leak when concurrent nfsd4_open occur

The action force umount(umount -f) will attempt to kill all rpc_task even
umount operation may ultimately fail if some files remain open.
Consequently, if an action attempts to open a file, it can potentially
send two rpc_task to nfs server.

                   NFS CLIENT

    ...
    nfs4_run_open_task
     /* rpc_task2 */
     rpc_run_task
     rpc_wait_for_completion_task

While processing an open request, nfsd will first attempt to find or
allocate an nfs4_openowner. If it finds an nfs4_openowner that is not
marked as NFS4_OO_CONFIRMED, this nfs4_openowner will released. Since
two rpc_task can attempt to open the same file simultaneously from the
client to server, and because two instances of nfsd can run
concurrently, this situation can lead to lots of memory leak.
Additionally, when we echo 0 to /proc/fs/nfsd/threads, warning will be
triggered.

CVE-2024-57929,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dm array: fix releasing a faulty array block twice in dm_array_cursor_end

When dm_bm_read_lock() fails due to locking or checksum errors, it
releases the faulty block implicitly while leaving an invalid output
pointer behind. The caller of dm_bm_read_lock() should not operate on
this invalid dm_block pointer, or it will lead to undefined result.
For example, the dm_array_cursor incorrectly caches the invalid pointer
on reading a faulty array block, causing a double release in
dm_array_cursor_end(), then hitting the BUG_ON in dm-bufio cache_put().

Reproduce steps:

1. initialize a cache device

dmsetup create cmeta --table ""0 8192 linear /dev/sdc 0""
dmsetup create cdata --table ""0 65536 linear /dev/sdc 8192""
dmsetup create corig --table ""0 524288 linear /dev/sdc $262144""
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/mapper/cmeta bs=4k count=1
dmsetup create cache --table ""0 524288 cache /dev/mapper/cmeta \
/dev/mapper/cdata /dev/mapper/corig 128 2 metadata2 writethrough smq 0""

2. wipe the second array block offline

dmsteup remove cache cmeta cdata corig
mapping_root=$(dd if=/dev/sdc bs=1c count=8 skip=192 \
2>/dev/null | hexdump -e '1/8 ""%u\n""')
ablock=$(dd if=/dev/sdc bs=1c count=8 skip=$((4096*mapping_root+2056)) \
2>/dev/null | hexdump -e '1/8 ""%u\n""')
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdc bs=4k count=1 seek=$ablock

3. try reopen the cache device

dmsetup create cmeta --table ""0 8192 linear /dev/sdc 0""
dmsetup create cdata --table ""0 65536 linear /dev/sdc 8192""
dmsetup create corig --table ""0 524288 linear /dev/sdc $262144""
dmsetup create cache --table ""0 524288 cache /dev/mapper/cmeta \
/dev/mapper/cdata /dev/mapper/corig 128 2 metadata2 writethrough smq 0""

CVE-2024-56669,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommu/vt-d: Remove cache tags before disabling ATS

The current implementation removes cache tags after disabling ATS,
leading to potential memory leaks and kernel crashes. Specifically,
CACHE_TAG_DEVTLB type cache tags may still remain in the list even
after the domain is freed, causing a use-after-free condition.

This issue really shows up when multiple VFs from different PFs
passed through to a single user-space process via vfio-pci. In such
cases, the kernel may crash with kernel messages like:

CVE-2024-56568,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommu/arm-smmu: Defer probe of clients after smmu device bound

Null pointer dereference occurs due to a race between smmu
driver probe and client driver probe, when of_dma_configure()
for client is called after the iommu_device_register() for smmu driver
probe has executed but before the driver_bound() for smmu driver
has been called.

Following is how the race occurs:

T1:Smmu device probe		T2: Client device probe

really_probe()
arm_smmu_device_probe()
iommu_device_register()
					really_probe()
					platform_dma_configure()
					of_dma_configure()
					of_dma_configure_id()
					of_iommu_configure()
					iommu_probe_device()
					iommu_init_device()
					arm_smmu_probe_device()
					arm_smmu_get_by_fwnode()
						driver_find_device_by_fwnode()
						driver_find_device()
						next_device()
						klist_next()
						    /* null ptr
						       assigned to smmu */
					/* null ptr dereference
					   while smmu->streamid_mask */
driver_bound()
	klist_add_tail()

When this null smmu pointer is dereferenced later in
arm_smmu_probe_device, the device crashes.

Fix this by deferring the probe of the client device
until the smmu device has bound to the arm smmu driver.

CVE-2024-56668,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommu/vt-d: Fix qi_batch NULL pointer with nested parent domain

The qi_batch is allocated when assigning cache tag for a domain. While
for nested parent domain, it is missed. Hence, when trying to map pages
to the nested parent, NULL dereference occurred. Also, there is potential
memleak since there is no lock around domain->qi_batch allocation.

To solve it, add a helper for qi_batch allocation, and call it in both
the __cache_tag_assign_domain() and __cache_tag_assign_parent_domain().

CVE-2024-50271,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

signal: restore the override_rlimit logic

Prior to commit d64696905554 (""Reimplement RLIMIT_SIGPENDING on top of
ucounts"") UCOUNT_RLIMIT_SIGPENDING rlimit was not enforced for a class of
signals.  However now it's enforced unconditionally, even if
override_rlimit is set.  This behavior change caused production issues.  

For example, if the limit is reached and a process receives a SIGSEGV
signal, sigqueue_alloc fails to allocate the necessary resources for the
signal delivery, preventing the signal from being delivered with siginfo. 
This prevents the process from correctly identifying the fault address and
handling the error.  From the user-space perspective, applications are
unaware that the limit has been reached and that the siginfo is
effectively 'corrupted'.  This can lead to unpredictable behavior and
crashes, as we observed with java applications.

Fix this by passing override_rlimit into inc_rlimit_get_ucounts() and skip
the comparison to max there if override_rlimit is set.  This effectively
restores the old behavior.",'-,5.5,258311,CentOS Stream Security update for kernel,4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 6, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,149355761,srvdmzcdi17v.czech.ch,10.43.225.219,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feb9:292c,Refer to CentOS security advisory kernel for updates and patch information.(https://kojihub.stream.centos.org/koji/buildinfo?buildID=74602),"CH,Cloud Agent,All",No,No,'-,25,"Feb 5, 2025","Feb 4, 2025",CentOS,HIGH,High Lateral Movement,CentOS Stream 9,'-,'-,131,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",No,2,340,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-43882,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

exec: Fix ToCToU between perm check and set-uid/gid usage

When opening a file for exec via do_filp_open(), permission checking is
done against the file's metadata at that moment, and on success, a file
pointer is passed back. Much later in the execve() code path, the file
metadata (specifically mode, uid, and gid) is used to determine if/how
to set the uid and gid. However, those values may have changed since the
permissions check, meaning the execution may gain unintended privileges.

For example, if a file could change permissions from executable and not
set-id:

---------x 1 root root 16048 Aug  7 13:16 target

to set-id and non-executable:

---S------ 1 root root 16048 Aug  7 13:16 target

it is possible to gain root privileges when execution should have been
disallowed.

While this race condition is rare in real-world scenarios, it has been
observed (and proven exploitable) when package managers are updating
the setuid bits of installed programs. Such files start with being
world-executable but then are adjusted to be group-exec with a set-uid
bit. For example, ""chmod o-x,u+s target"" makes ""target"" executable only
by uid ""root"" and gid ""cdrom"", while also becoming setuid-root:

-rwxr-xr-x 1 root cdrom 16048 Aug  7 13:16 target

becomes:

-rwsr-xr-- 1 root cdrom 16048 Aug  7 13:16 target

But racing the chmod means users without group ""cdrom"" membership can
get the permission to execute ""target"" just before the chmod, and when
the chmod finishes, the exec reaches brpm_fill_uid(), and performs the
setuid to root, violating the expressed authorization of ""only cdrom
group members can setuid to root"".

Re-check that we still have execute permissions in case the metadata
has changed. It would be better to keep a copy from the perm-check time,
but until we can do that refactoring, the least-bad option is to do a
full inode_permission() call (under inode lock). It is understood that
this is safe against dead-locks, but hardly optimal.",'-,7,258311,CentOS Stream Security update for kernel,4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 6, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,149355761,srvdmzcdi17v.czech.ch,10.43.225.219,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feb9:292c,Refer to CentOS security advisory kernel for updates and patch information.(https://kojihub.stream.centos.org/koji/buildinfo?buildID=74602),"CH,Cloud Agent,All",No,No,35,25,"Feb 5, 2025","Feb 4, 2025",CentOS,HIGH,High Lateral Movement,CentOS Stream 9,'-,'-,131,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",No,2,340,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-47742,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

firmware_loader: Block path traversal

Most firmware names are hardcoded strings, or are constructed from fairly
constrained format strings where the dynamic parts are just some hex
numbers or such.

However, there are a couple codepaths in the kernel where firmware file
names contain string components that are passed through from a device or
semi-privileged userspace; the ones I could find (not counting interfaces
that require root privileges) are:

 - lpfc_sli4_request_firmware_update() seems to construct the firmware
   filename from ""ModelName"", a string that was previously parsed out of
   some descriptor (""Vital Product Data"") in lpfc_fill_vpd()
 - nfp_net_fw_find() seems to construct a firmware filename from a model
   name coming from nfp_hwinfo_lookup(pf->hwinfo, ""nffw.partno""), which I
   think parses some descriptor that was read from the device.
   (But this case likely isn't exploitable because the format string looks
   like ""netronome/nic_%s"", and there shouldn't be any *folders* starting
   with ""netronome/nic_"". The previous case was different because there,
   the ""%s"" is *at the start* of the format string.)
 - module_flash_fw_schedule() is reachable from the
   ETHTOOL_MSG_MODULE_FW_FLASH_ACT netlink command, which is marked as
   GENL_UNS_ADMIN_PERM (meaning CAP_NET_ADMIN inside a user namespace is
   enough to pass the privilege check), and takes a userspace-provided
   firmware name.
   (But I think to reach this case, you need to have CAP_NET_ADMIN over a
   network namespace that a special kind of ethernet device is mapped into,
   so I think this is not a viable attack path in practice.)

Fix it by rejecting any firmware names containing "".."" path components.

For what it's worth, I went looking and haven't found any USB device
drivers that use the firmware loader dangerously.",'-,7.8,358475,Amazon Linux Security Advisory for kernel : ALAS2-2025-2745,4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 6, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,197477842,ptaws-sv-uhapi1.portugal.pt,"10.64.192.239,172.17.0.1,172.18.0.1","fe80:0:0:0:42:88ff:fe5d:ae1a,fe80:0:0:0:8df:bdff:fe2f:9db5,fe80:0:0:0:1882:b0ff:fe4d:11e4","Please refer to Amazon advisory: ALAS2-2025-2745 for affected packages and patching details, or update with your package manager.(https://alas.aws.amazon.com/AL2/ALAS-2025-2745.html)","PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,35,25,"Feb 5, 2025","Jan 30, 2025",Amazon Linux,HIGH,High Lateral Movement,Amazon Linux 2,'-,'-,137,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a securitybreach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,337,,"#table cols=""3""

uprobe: avoid out-of-bounds memory access of fetching args

Uprobe needs to fetch args into a percpu buffer, and then copy to ring
buffer to avoid non-atomic context problem.

Sometimes user-space strings, arrays can be very large, but the size of
percpu buffer is only page size. And store_trace_args() won't check
whether these data exceeds a single page or not, caused out-of-bounds
memory access.

It could be reproduced by following steps:
1. build kernel with CONFIG_KASAN enabled
2. save follow program as test.c

```
\#include <stdio.h>
\#include <stdlib.h>
\#include <string.h>

// If string length large than MAX_STRING_SIZE, the fetch_store_strlen()
// will return 0, cause __get_data_size() return shorter size, and
// store_trace_args() will not trigger out-of-bounds access.
// So make string length less than 4096.

    generate_string(tmp, STRLEN);
    print_string(tmp);

```
3. compile program
`gcc -o test test.c`

4. get the offset of `print_string()`
```
objdump -t test | grep -w print_string
0000000000401199 g     F .text  000000000000001b              print_string
```

5. configure uprobe with offset 0x1199
```
off=0x1199

cd /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/
echo ""p /root/test:${off} arg1=+0(%di):ustring arg2=\$comm arg3=+0(%di):ustring""
 > uprobe_events
echo 1 > events/uprobes/enable
echo 1 > tracing_on

CVE-2024-26852,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/ipv6: avoid possible UAF in ip6_route_mpath_notify()

syzbot found another use-after-free in ip6_route_mpath_notify() [1]

Commit f7225172f25a (""net/ipv6: prevent use after free in
ip6_route_mpath_notify"") was not able to fix the root cause.

We need to defer the fib6_info_release() calls after
ip6_route_mpath_notify(), in the cleanup phase.

CVE-2024-50230,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nilfs2: fix kernel bug due to missing clearing of checked flag

Syzbot reported that in directory operations after nilfs2 detects
filesystem corruption and degrades to read-only,
__block_write_begin_int(), which is called to prepare block writes, may
fail the BUG_ON check for accesses exceeding the folio/page size,
triggering a kernel bug.

This was found to be because the ""checked"" flag of a page/folio was not
cleared when it was discarded by nilfs2's own routine, which causes the
sanity check of directory entries to be skipped when the directory
page/folio is reloaded.  So, fix that.

This was necessary when the use of nilfs2's own page discard routine was
applied to more than just metadata files.",'-,7.8,358475,Amazon Linux Security Advisory for kernel : ALAS2-2025-2745,4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 6, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,197477842,ptaws-sv-uhapi1.portugal.pt,"10.64.192.239,172.17.0.1,172.18.0.1","fe80:0:0:0:42:88ff:fe5d:ae1a,fe80:0:0:0:8df:bdff:fe2f:9db5,fe80:0:0:0:1882:b0ff:fe4d:11e4","Please refer to Amazon advisory: ALAS2-2025-2745 for affected packages and patching details, or update with your package manager.(https://alas.aws.amazon.com/AL2/ALAS-2025-2745.html)","PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,35,25,"Feb 5, 2025","Jan 30, 2025",Amazon Linux,HIGH,High Lateral Movement,Amazon Linux 2,'-,'-,137,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a securitybreach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,337,,"#table cols=""3""

The flow of issue triggering is as follows:

ext4_split_extent_at
  path = *ppath
  ext4_ext_insert_extent(ppath)
    ext4_ext_create_new_leaf(ppath)
      ext4_find_extent(orig_path)

        read_extent_tree_block

        ext4_free_ext_path(path)
          kfree(path)
        *orig_path = NULL
  a. If err is -ENOMEM:
  ext4_ext_dirty(path + path->p_depth)
  // path use-after-free !!!
  b. If err is -EIO and we have EXT_DEBUG defined:
  ext4_ext_show_leaf(path)
    eh = path[depth].p_hdr
    // path also use-after-free !!!

So when trying to zeroout or fix the extent length, call ext4_find_extent()
to update the path.

In addition we use *ppath directly as an ext4_ext_show_leaf() input to
avoid possible use-after-free when EXT_DEBUG is defined, and to avoid
unnecessary path updates.",'-,7.8,358475,Amazon Linux Security Advisory for kernel : ALAS2-2025-2745,4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 6, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,197477842,ptaws-sv-uhapi1.portugal.pt,"10.64.192.239,172.17.0.1,172.18.0.1","fe80:0:0:0:42:88ff:fe5d:ae1a,fe80:0:0:0:8df:bdff:fe2f:9db5,fe80:0:0:0:1882:b0ff:fe4d:11e4","Please refer to Amazon advisory: ALAS2-2025-2745 for affected packages and patching details, or update with your package manager.(https://alas.aws.amazon.com/AL2/ALAS-2025-2745.html)","PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,35,25,"Feb 5, 2025","Jan 30, 2025",Amazon Linux,HIGH,High Lateral Movement,Amazon Linux 2,'-,'-,137,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a securitybreach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,337,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-45337,"Applications and libraries which misuse connection.serverAuthenticate (via callback field ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback) may be susceptible to an authorization bypass. The documentation for ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback says that ""A call to this function does not guarantee that the key offered is in fact used to authenticate."" Specifically, the SSH protocol allows clients to inquire about whether a public key is acceptable before proving control of the corresponding private key. PublicKeyCallback may be called with multiple keys, and the order in which the keys were provided cannot be used to infer which key the client successfully authenticated with, if any. Some applications, which store the key(s) passed to PublicKeyCallback (or derived information) and make security relevant determinations based on it once the connection is established, may make incorrect assumptions. For example, an attacker may send public keys A and B, and then authenticate with A. PublicKeyCallback would be called only twice, first with A and then with B. A vulnerable application may then make authorization decisions based on key B for which the attacker does not actually control the private key. Since this API is widely misused, as a partial mitigation golang.org/x/cry...@v0.31.0 enforces the property that, when successfully authenticating via public key, the last key passed to ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback will be the key used to authenticate the connection. PublicKeyCallback will now be called multiple times with the same key, if necessary. Note that the client may still not control the last key passed to PublicKeyCallback if the connection is then authenticated with a different method, such as PasswordCallback, KeyboardInteractiveCallback, or NoClientAuth. Users should be using the Extensions field of the Permissions return value from the various authentication callbacks to record data associated with the authentication attempt instead of referencing external state. Once the connection is established the state corresponding to the successful authentication attempt can be retrieved via the ServerConn.Permissions field. Note that some third-party libraries misuse the Permissions type by sharing it across authentication attempts; users of third-party libraries should refer to the relevant projects for guidance.",'-,'-,358468,Amazon Linux Security Advisory for containerd : ALAS2DOCKER-2025-049,4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 6, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,197477842,ptaws-sv-uhapi1.portugal.pt,"10.64.192.239,172.17.0.1,172.18.0.1","fe80:0:0:0:42:88ff:fe5d:ae1a,fe80:0:0:0:8df:bdff:fe2f:9db5,fe80:0:0:0:1882:b0ff:fe4d:11e4","Please refer to Amazon advisory: ALAS2DOCKER-2025-049 for affected packages and patching details, or update with your package manager.(https://alas.aws.amazon.com/AL2/ALASDOCKER-2025-049.html)","PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,72,25,"Feb 5, 2025","Jan 31, 2025",Amazon Linux,CRITICAL,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit",Amazon Linux 2,'-,'-,137,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a securitybreach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,337,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-47606,"GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. An integer underflow has been detected in the function qtdemux_parse_theora_extension within qtdemux.c. The vulnerability occurs due to an underflow of the gint size variable, which causes size to hold a large unintended value when cast to an unsigned integer. This 32-bit negative value is then cast to a 64-bit unsigned integer (0xfffffffffffffffa) in a subsequent call to gst_buffer_new_and_alloc. The function gst_buffer_new_allocate then attempts to allocate memory, eventually calling _sysmem_new_block. The function _sysmem_new_block adds alignment and header size to the (unsigned) size, causing the overflow of the 'slice_size' variable. As a result, only 0x89 bytes are allocated, despite the large input size. When the following memcpy call occurs in gst_buffer_fill, the data from the input file will overwrite the content of the GstMapInfo info structure. Finally, during the call to gst_memory_unmap, the overwritten memory may cause a function pointer hijack, as the mem->allocator->mem_unmap_full function is called with a corrupted pointer.

CVE-2024-57929,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dm array: fix releasing a faulty array block twice in dm_array_cursor_end

When dm_bm_read_lock() fails due to locking or checksum errors, it
releases the faulty block implicitly while leaving an invalid output
pointer behind. The caller of dm_bm_read_lock() should not operate on
this invalid dm_block pointer, or it will lead to undefined result.
For example, the dm_array_cursor incorrectly caches the invalid pointer
on reading a faulty array block, causing a double release in
dm_array_cursor_end(), then hitting the BUG_ON in dm-bufio cache_put().

Reproduce steps:

1. initialize a cache device

dmsetup create cmeta --table ""0 8192 linear /dev/sdc 0""
dmsetup create cdata --table ""0 65536 linear /dev/sdc 8192""
dmsetup create corig --table ""0 524288 linear /dev/sdc $262144""
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/mapper/cmeta bs=4k count=1
dmsetup create cache --table ""0 524288 cache /dev/mapper/cmeta \
/dev/mapper/cdata /dev/mapper/corig 128 2 metadata2 writethrough smq 0""

2. wipe the second array block offline

dmsteup remove cache cmeta cdata corig
mapping_root=$(dd if=/dev/sdc bs=1c count=8 skip=192 \
2>/dev/null | hexdump -e '1/8 ""%u\n""')
ablock=$(dd if=/dev/sdc bs=1c count=8 skip=$((4096*mapping_root+2056)) \
2>/dev/null | hexdump -e '1/8 ""%u\n""')
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdc bs=4k count=1 seek=$ablock

3. try reopen the cache device

dmsetup create cmeta --table ""0 8192 linear /dev/sdc 0""
dmsetup create cdata --table ""0 65536 linear /dev/sdc 8192""
dmsetup create corig --table ""0 524288 linear /dev/sdc $262144""
dmsetup create cache --table ""0 524288 cache /dev/mapper/cmeta \
/dev/mapper/cdata /dev/mapper/corig 128 2 metadata2 writethrough smq 0""

CVE-2024-56568,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommu/arm-smmu: Defer probe of clients after smmu device bound

Null pointer dereference occurs due to a race between smmu
driver probe and client driver probe, when of_dma_configure()
for client is called after the iommu_device_register() for smmu driver
probe has executed but before the driver_bound() for smmu driver
has been called.

Following is how the race occurs:

T1:Smmu device probe		T2: Client device probe

really_probe()
arm_smmu_device_probe()
iommu_device_register()
					really_probe()
					platform_dma_configure()
					of_dma_configure()
					of_dma_configure_id()
					of_iommu_configure()
					iommu_probe_device()
					iommu_init_device()
					arm_smmu_probe_device()
					arm_smmu_get_by_fwnode()
						driver_find_device_by_fwnode()
						driver_find_device()
						next_device()
						klist_next()
						    /* null ptr
						       assigned to smmu */
					/* null ptr dereference
					   while smmu->streamid_mask */
driver_bound()
	klist_add_tail()

When this null smmu pointer is dereferenced later in
arm_smmu_probe_device, the device crashes.

Fix this by deferring the probe of the client device
until the smmu device has bound to the arm smmu driver.

iommu/vt-d: Fix qi_batch NULL pointer with nested parent domain

The qi_batch is allocated when assigning cache tag for a domain. While
for nested parent domain, it is missed. Hence, when trying to map pages

memleak since there is no lock around domain->qi_batch allocation.

To solve it, add a helper for qi_batch allocation, and call it in both

CVE-2024-50271,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

signal: restore the override_rlimit logic

Prior to commit d64696905554 (""Reimplement RLIMIT_SIGPENDING on top of
ucounts"") UCOUNT_RLIMIT_SIGPENDING rlimit was not enforced for a class of
signals.  However now it's enforced unconditionally, even if
override_rlimit is set.  This behavior change caused production issues.  

For example, if the limit is reached and a process receives a SIGSEGV
signal, sigqueue_alloc fails to allocate the necessary resources for the
signal delivery, preventing the signal from being delivered with siginfo. 
This prevents the process from correctly identifying the fault address and
handling the error.  From the user-space perspective, applications are
unaware that the limit has been reached and that the siginfo is
effectively 'corrupted'.  This can lead to unpredictable behavior and
crashes, as we observed with java applications.

Fix this by passing override_rlimit into inc_rlimit_get_ucounts() and skip
the comparison to max there if override_rlimit is set.  This effectively
restores the old behavior.",'-,5.5,258311,CentOS Stream Security update for kernel,4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 5, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,149355753,srvdmzcdi18v.czech.ch,10.43.225.220,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feb9:b3a2,Refer to CentOS security advisory kernel for updates and patch information.(https://kojihub.stream.centos.org/koji/buildinfo?buildID=74602),"CH,Cloud Agent,All",No,No,'-,25,"Feb 5, 2025","Feb 4, 2025",CentOS,HIGH,High Lateral Movement,CentOS Stream 9,'-,'-,129,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",No,2,340,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-43882,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

exec: Fix ToCToU between perm check and set-uid/gid usage

When opening a file for exec via do_filp_open(), permission checking is
done against the file's metadata at that moment, and on success, a file
pointer is passed back. Much later in the execve() code path, the file
metadata (specifically mode, uid, and gid) is used to determine if/how
to set the uid and gid. However, those values may have changed since the
permissions check, meaning the execution may gain unintended privileges.

For example, if a file could change permissions from executable and not
set-id:

---------x 1 root root 16048 Aug  7 13:16 target

to set-id and non-executable:

---S------ 1 root root 16048 Aug  7 13:16 target

it is possible to gain root privileges when execution should have been
disallowed.

While this race condition is rare in real-world scenarios, it has been
observed (and proven exploitable) when package managers are updating
the setuid bits of installed programs. Such files start with being
world-executable but then are adjusted to be group-exec with a set-uid
bit. For example, ""chmod o-x,u+s target"" makes ""target"" executable only
by uid ""root"" and gid ""cdrom"", while also becoming setuid-root:

-rwxr-xr-x 1 root cdrom 16048 Aug  7 13:16 target

becomes:

-rwsr-xr-- 1 root cdrom 16048 Aug  7 13:16 target

But racing the chmod means users without group ""cdrom"" membership can
get the permission to execute ""target"" just before the chmod, and when
the chmod finishes, the exec reaches brpm_fill_uid(), and performs the
setuid to root, violating the expressed authorization of ""only cdrom
group members can setuid to root"".

Re-check that we still have execute permissions in case the metadata
has changed. It would be better to keep a copy from the perm-check time,
but until we can do that refactoring, the least-bad option is to do a
full inode_permission() call (under inode lock). It is understood that
this is safe against dead-locks, but hardly optimal.",'-,7,258311,CentOS Stream Security update for kernel,4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 5, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,149355753,srvdmzcdi18v.czech.ch,10.43.225.220,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feb9:b3a2,Refer to CentOS security advisory kernel for updates and patch information.(https://kojihub.stream.centos.org/koji/buildinfo?buildID=74602),"CH,Cloud Agent,All",No,No,35,25,"Feb 5, 2025","Feb 4, 2025",CentOS,HIGH,High Lateral Movement,CentOS Stream 9,'-,'-,129,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",No,2,340,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-53142,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

initramfs: avoid filename buffer overrun

The initramfs filename field is defined in
Documentation/driver-api/early-userspace/buffer-format.rst as:

 37 cpio_file := ALGN(4) + cpio_header + filename + ""\0"" + ALGN(4) + data
...
 55 ============= ================== =========================
 56 Field name    Field size         Meaning
 57 ============= ================== =========================
...
 70 c_namesize    8 bytes            Length of filename, including final \0

When extracting an initramfs cpio archive, the kernel's do_name() path
handler assumes a zero-terminated path at @collected, passing it
directly to filp_open() / init_mkdir() / init_mknod().

If a specially crafted cpio entry carries a non-zero-terminated filename
and is followed by uninitialized memory, then a file may be created with
trailing characters that represent the uninitialized memory. The ability
to create an initramfs entry would imply already having full control of
the system, so the buffer overrun shouldn't be considered a security
vulnerability.

Append the output of the following bash script to an existing initramfs
and observe any created /initramfs_test_fname_overrunAA* path. E.g.
  ./reproducer.sh | gzip >> /myinitramfs

It's easiest to observe non-zero uninitialized memory when the output is
gzipped, as it'll overflow the heap allocated @out_buf in __gunzip(),
rather than the initrd_start+initrd_size block.

CVE-2024-56779,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nfsd: fix nfs4_openowner leak when concurrent nfsd4_open occur

The action force umount(umount -f) will attempt to kill all rpc_task even
umount operation may ultimately fail if some files remain open.
Consequently, if an action attempts to open a file, it can potentially
send two rpc_task to nfs server.

                   NFS CLIENT
thread1                             thread2

     rpc_run_task
     rpc_wait_for_completion_task

                                    nfs_umount_begin
                                     rpc_killall_tasks

     rpc_task1 been wakeup

    ...
    nfs4_run_open_task
     /* rpc_task2 */
     rpc_run_task
     rpc_wait_for_completion_task

While processing an open request, nfsd will first attempt to find or
allocate an nfs4_openowner. If it finds an nfs4_openowner that is not
marked as NFS4_OO_CONFIRMED, this nfs4_openowner will released. Since
two rpc_task can attempt to open the same file simultaneously from the
client to server, and because two instances of nfsd can run
concurrently, this situation can lead to lots of memory leak.
Additionally, when we echo 0 to /proc/fs/nfsd/threads, warning will be
triggered.

CVE-2024-57929,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dm array: fix releasing a faulty array block twice in dm_array_cursor_end

When dm_bm_read_lock() fails due to locking or checksum errors, it
releases the faulty block implicitly while leaving an invalid output
pointer behind. The caller of dm_bm_read_lock() should not operate on
this invalid dm_block pointer, or it will lead to undefined result.
For example, the dm_array_cursor incorrectly caches the invalid pointer
on reading a faulty array block, causing a double release in
dm_array_cursor_end(), then hitting the BUG_ON in dm-bufio cache_put().

Reproduce steps:

1. initialize a cache device

dmsetup create cmeta --table ""0 8192 linear /dev/sdc 0""
dmsetup create cdata --table ""0 65536 linear /dev/sdc 8192""
dmsetup create corig --table ""0 524288 linear /dev/sdc $262144""
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/mapper/cmeta bs=4k count=1
dmsetup create cache --table ""0 524288 cache /dev/mapper/cmeta \
/dev/mapper/cdata /dev/mapper/corig 128 2 metadata2 writethrough smq 0""

2. wipe the second array block offline

dmsteup remove cache cmeta cdata corig

CVE-2024-56669,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommu/vt-d: Remove cache tags before disabling ATS

The current implementation removes cache tags after disabling ATS,
leading to potential memory leaks and kernel crashes. Specifically,
CACHE_TAG_DEVTLB type cache tags may still remain in the list even
after the domain is freed, causing a use-after-free condition.

This issue really shows up when multiple VFs from different PFs
passed through to a single user-space process via vfio-pci. In such
cases, the kernel may crash with kernel messages like:

CVE-2024-56568,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommu/arm-smmu: Defer probe of clients after smmu device bound

Null pointer dereference occurs due to a race between smmu
driver probe and client driver probe, when of_dma_configure()
for client is called after the iommu_device_register() for smmu driver
probe has executed but before the driver_bound() for smmu driver
has been called.

Following is how the race occurs:

T1:Smmu device probe		T2: Client device probe

really_probe()
arm_smmu_device_probe()
iommu_device_register()
					really_probe()
					platform_dma_configure()
					of_dma_configure()
					of_dma_configure_id()
					of_iommu_configure()
					iommu_probe_device()
					iommu_init_device()
					arm_smmu_probe_device()
					arm_smmu_get_by_fwnode()
						driver_find_device_by_fwnode()
						driver_find_device()
						next_device()
						klist_next()
						    /* null ptr
						       assigned to smmu */
					/* null ptr dereference
					   while smmu->streamid_mask */
driver_bound()
	klist_add_tail()

When this null smmu pointer is dereferenced later in
arm_smmu_probe_device, the device crashes.

Fix this by deferring the probe of the client device
until the smmu device has bound to the arm smmu driver.

iommu/vt-d: Fix qi_batch NULL pointer with nested parent domain

The qi_batch is allocated when assigning cache tag for a domain. While
for nested parent domain, it is missed. Hence, when trying to map pages
to the nested parent, NULL dereference occurred. Also, there is potential
memleak since there is no lock around domain->qi_batch allocation.

To solve it, add a helper for qi_batch allocation, and call it in both
the __cache_tag_assign_domain() and __cache_tag_assign_parent_domain().

This fixes a crash when surprise hot-unplugging a PCI device. This crash
happens because during hot-unplug __iommu_group_set_domain_nofail()
attaching the default domain fails when the platform no longer
recognizes the device as it has already been removed and we end up with
a NULL domain pointer and UAF. This is exactly the case referred to in
the second comment in __iommu_device_set_domain() and just as stated
there if we can instead attach the blocking domain the UAF is prevented
as this can handle the already removed device. Implement the blocking
domain to use this handling.  With this change, the crash is fixed but

CVE-2024-50271,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

signal: restore the override_rlimit logic

Prior to commit d64696905554 (""Reimplement RLIMIT_SIGPENDING on top of
ucounts"") UCOUNT_RLIMIT_SIGPENDING rlimit was not enforced for a class of
signals.  However now it's enforced unconditionally, even if
override_rlimit is set.  This behavior change caused production issues.  

For example, if the limit is reached and a process receives a SIGSEGV
signal, sigqueue_alloc fails to allocate the necessary resources for the
signal delivery, preventing the signal from being delivered with siginfo. 
This prevents the process from correctly identifying the fault address and
handling the error.  From the user-space perspective, applications are
unaware that the limit has been reached and that the siginfo is
effectively 'corrupted'.  This can lead to unpredictable behavior and
crashes, as we observed with java applications.

Fix this by passing override_rlimit into inc_rlimit_get_ucounts() and skip
the comparison to max there if override_rlimit is set.  This effectively
restores the old behavior.",'-,5.5,258311,CentOS Stream Security update for kernel,4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 6, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,149342029,srvdmzcdi32v.czech.ch,"10.43.225.217,172.17.0.1,172.20.0.1","fe80:0:0:0:42:9dff:fe5b:d81b,fe80:0:0:0:42:efff:fed8:1601,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feb9:6d5f,fe80:0:0:0:808:c1ff:fee8:8c2c,fe80:0:0:0:81e:eaff:fe51:c4d5,fe80:0:0:0:c55:10ff:fe2c:6a97,fe80:0:0:0:144c:3aff:fe42:716a,fe80:0:0:0:189b:56ff:fed5:8655,fe80:0:0:0:1ce0:97ff:fe0a:e75e,fe80:0:0:0:203b:9aff:fe52:1e42,fe80:0:0:0:342d:30ff:fefa:b7eb,fe80:0:0:0:38f7:51ff:fe4c:cb31,fe80:0:0:0:4018:38ff:fe18:ea10,fe80:0:0:0:489d:82ff:fe0b:3baf,fe80:0:0:0:58c2:7ff:fe50:282b,fe80:0:0:0:600f:3aff:fe85:50d4,fe80:0:0:0:6cbf:6ff:fef2:bb33,fe80:0:0:0:7028:36ff:fe51:99af,fe80:0:0:0:74b6:90ff:fe5a:f1fd,fe80:0:0:0:74be:b0ff:fe3c:b8df,fe80:0:0:0:80c4:e9ff:fe10:ef44,fe80:0:0:0:84a8:e5ff:fe5e:b0c3,fe80:0:0:0:84cb:ceff:fe45:7eb5,fe80:0:0:0:88cd:b9ff:fea0:a42d,fe80:0:0:0:8c49:37ff:febc:1a6a,fe80:0:0:0:9459:caff:fe41:ce07,fe80:0:0:0:bc63:c0ff:fe91:c815,fe80:0:0:0:bc77:48ff:fe31:8672,fe80:0:0:0:c8c1:67ff:fe0b:130a,fe80:0:0:0:dcd0:dfff:feb5:788b,fe80:0:0:0:e09f:86ff:feb1:ea17,fe80:0:0:0:f814:73ff:fe82:d796",Refer to CentOS security advisory kernel for updates and patch information.(https://kojihub.stream.centos.org/koji/buildinfo?buildID=74602),"CH,Cloud Agent,All",No,No,'-,25,"Feb 5, 2025","Feb 4, 2025",CentOS,HIGH,High Lateral Movement,CentOS Stream 9,'-,'-,134,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",No,2,340,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-53213,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: usb: lan78xx: Fix double free issue with interrupt buffer allocation

In lan78xx_probe(), the buffer `buf` was being freed twice: once
implicitly through `usb_free_urb(dev->urb_intr)` with the
`URB_FREE_BUFFER` flag and again explicitly by `kfree(buf)`. This caused
a double free issue.

To resolve this, reordered `kmalloc()` and `usb_alloc_urb()` calls to
simplify the initialization sequence and removed the redundant

CVE-2024-43882,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

exec: Fix ToCToU between perm check and set-uid/gid usage

When opening a file for exec via do_filp_open(), permission checking is
done against the file's metadata at that moment, and on success, a file
pointer is passed back. Much later in the execve() code path, the file
metadata (specifically mode, uid, and gid) is used to determine if/how
to set the uid and gid. However, those values may have changed since the
permissions check, meaning the execution may gain unintended privileges.

For example, if a file could change permissions from executable and not
set-id:

---------x 1 root root 16048 Aug  7 13:16 target

to set-id and non-executable:

---S------ 1 root root 16048 Aug  7 13:16 target

it is possible to gain root privileges when execution should have been
disallowed.

While this race condition is rare in real-world scenarios, it has been
observed (and proven exploitable) when package managers are updating
the setuid bits of installed programs. Such files start with being
world-executable but then are adjusted to be group-exec with a set-uid
bit. For example, ""chmod o-x,u+s target"" makes ""target"" executable only
by uid ""root"" and gid ""cdrom"", while also becoming setuid-root:

-rwxr-xr-x 1 root cdrom 16048 Aug  7 13:16 target

becomes:

-rwsr-xr-- 1 root cdrom 16048 Aug  7 13:16 target

But racing the chmod means users without group ""cdrom"" membership can
get the permission to execute ""target"" just before the chmod, and when
the chmod finishes, the exec reaches brpm_fill_uid(), and performs the
setuid to root, violating the expressed authorization of ""only cdrom
group members can setuid to root"".

Re-check that we still have execute permissions in case the metadata
has changed. It would be better to keep a copy from the perm-check time,
but until we can do that refactoring, the least-bad option is to do a
full inode_permission() call (under inode lock). It is understood that
this is safe against dead-locks, but hardly optimal.",'-,7,258311,CentOS Stream Security update for kernel,4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 6, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,149342029,srvdmzcdi32v.czech.ch,"10.43.225.217,172.17.0.1,172.20.0.1","fe80:0:0:0:42:9dff:fe5b:d81b,fe80:0:0:0:42:efff:fed8:1601,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feb9:6d5f,fe80:0:0:0:808:c1ff:fee8:8c2c,fe80:0:0:0:81e:eaff:fe51:c4d5,fe80:0:0:0:c55:10ff:fe2c:6a97,fe80:0:0:0:144c:3aff:fe42:716a,fe80:0:0:0:189b:56ff:fed5:8655,fe80:0:0:0:1ce0:97ff:fe0a:e75e,fe80:0:0:0:203b:9aff:fe52:1e42,fe80:0:0:0:342d:30ff:fefa:b7eb,fe80:0:0:0:38f7:51ff:fe4c:cb31,fe80:0:0:0:4018:38ff:fe18:ea10,fe80:0:0:0:489d:82ff:fe0b:3baf,fe80:0:0:0:58c2:7ff:fe50:282b,fe80:0:0:0:600f:3aff:fe85:50d4,fe80:0:0:0:6cbf:6ff:fef2:bb33,fe80:0:0:0:7028:36ff:fe51:99af,fe80:0:0:0:74b6:90ff:fe5a:f1fd,fe80:0:0:0:74be:b0ff:fe3c:b8df,fe80:0:0:0:80c4:e9ff:fe10:ef44,fe80:0:0:0:84a8:e5ff:fe5e:b0c3,fe80:0:0:0:84cb:ceff:fe45:7eb5,fe80:0:0:0:88cd:b9ff:fea0:a42d,fe80:0:0:0:8c49:37ff:febc:1a6a,fe80:0:0:0:9459:caff:fe41:ce07,fe80:0:0:0:bc63:c0ff:fe91:c815,fe80:0:0:0:bc77:48ff:fe31:8672,fe80:0:0:0:c8c1:67ff:fe0b:130a,fe80:0:0:0:dcd0:dfff:feb5:788b,fe80:0:0:0:e09f:86ff:feb1:ea17,fe80:0:0:0:f814:73ff:fe82:d796",Refer to CentOS security advisory kernel for updates and patch information.(https://kojihub.stream.centos.org/koji/buildinfo?buildID=74602),"CH,Cloud Agent,All",No,No,35,25,"Feb 5, 2025","Feb 4, 2025",CentOS,HIGH,High Lateral Movement,CentOS Stream 9,'-,'-,134,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",No,2,340,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-53142,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

initramfs: avoid filename buffer overrun

The initramfs filename field is defined in
Documentation/driver-api/early-userspace/buffer-format.rst as:

 37 cpio_file := ALGN(4) + cpio_header + filename + ""\0"" + ALGN(4) + data
...
 55 ============= ================== =========================
 56 Field name    Field size         Meaning
 57 ============= ================== =========================
...
 70 c_namesize    8 bytes            Length of filename, including final \0

When extracting an initramfs cpio archive, the kernel's do_name() path
handler assumes a zero-terminated path at @collected, passing it
directly to filp_open() / init_mkdir() / init_mknod().

If a specially crafted cpio entry carries a non-zero-terminated filename
and is followed by uninitialized memory, then a file may be created with
trailing characters that represent the uninitialized memory. The ability
to create an initramfs entry would imply already having full control of
the system, so the buffer overrun shouldn't be considered a security
vulnerability.

Append the output of the following bash script to an existing initramfs
and observe any created /initramfs_test_fname_overrunAA* path. E.g.
  ./reproducer.sh | gzip >> /myinitramfs

It's easiest to observe non-zero uninitialized memory when the output is
gzipped, as it'll overflow the heap allocated @out_buf in __gunzip(),
rather than the initrd_start+initrd_size block.

kfree_rcu_monitor() rearms the work if a ""krcp"" has to be still

the kvfree_call_rcu() holds it.

CVE-2024-56779,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nfsd: fix nfs4_openowner leak when concurrent nfsd4_open occur

The action force umount(umount -f) will attempt to kill all rpc_task even
umount operation may ultimately fail if some files remain open.
Consequently, if an action attempts to open a file, it can potentially
send two rpc_task to nfs server.

                   NFS CLIENT
thread1                             thread2
open(""file"")
...

   _nfs4_proc_open

     rpc_run_task
     rpc_wait_for_completion_task

                                    umount -f
                                    nfs_umount_begin
                                     rpc_killall_tasks
                                      rpc_signal_task
     rpc_task1 been wakeup
     and return -512
 _nfs4_do_open // while loop
    ...
    nfs4_run_open_task
     /* rpc_task2 */
     rpc_run_task
     rpc_wait_for_completion_task

While processing an open request, nfsd will first attempt to find or
allocate an nfs4_openowner. If it finds an nfs4_openowner that is not
marked as NFS4_OO_CONFIRMED, this nfs4_openowner will released. Since
two rpc_task can attempt to open the same file simultaneously from the
client to server, and because two instances of nfsd can run
concurrently, this situation can lead to lots of memory leak.
Additionally, when we echo 0 to /proc/fs/nfsd/threads, warning will be
triggered.

                    NFS SERVER

CVE-2024-50067,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

uprobe: avoid out-of-bounds memory access of fetching args

Uprobe needs to fetch args into a percpu buffer, and then copy to ring
buffer to avoid non-atomic context problem.

Sometimes user-space strings, arrays can be very large, but the size of
percpu buffer is only page size. And store_trace_args() won't check
whether these data exceeds a single page or not, caused out-of-bounds
memory access.

It could be reproduced by following steps:
1. build kernel with CONFIG_KASAN enabled
2. save follow program as test.c

```
\#include <stdio.h>
\#include <stdlib.h>
\#include <string.h>

// If string length large than MAX_STRING_SIZE, the fetch_store_strlen()
// will return 0, cause __get_data_size() return shorter size, and
// store_trace_args() will not trigger out-of-bounds access.
// So make string length less than 4096.
\#define STRLEN 4093

void generate_string(char *str, int n)
{
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i < n; ++i)
    {
        char c = i % 26 + 'a';
        str[i] = c;
    }
    str[n-1] = '\0';
}

void print_string(char *str)
{
    printf(""%s\n"", str);
}

int main()
{
    char tmp[STRLEN];

    generate_string(tmp, STRLEN);
    print_string(tmp);

    return 0;
}
```
3. compile program
`gcc -o test test.c`

4. get the offset of `print_string()`
```
objdump -t test | grep -w print_string
0000000000401199 g     F .text  000000000000001b              print_string
```

5. configure uprobe with offset 0x1199
```
off=0x1199

cd /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/
echo ""p /root/test:${off} arg1=+0(%di):ustring arg2=\$comm arg3=+0(%di):ustring""
 > uprobe_events
echo 1 > events/uprobes/enable
echo 1 > tracing_on
```

6. run `test`, and kasan will report error.

CVE-2024-50271,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

signal: restore the override_rlimit logic

Prior to commit d64696905554 (""Reimplement RLIMIT_SIGPENDING on top of
ucounts"") UCOUNT_RLIMIT_SIGPENDING rlimit was not enforced for a class of
signals.  However now it's enforced unconditionally, even if
override_rlimit is set.  This behavior change caused production issues.  

For example, if the limit is reached and a process receives a SIGSEGV
signal, sigqueue_alloc fails to allocate the necessary resources for the
signal delivery, preventing the signal from being delivered with siginfo. 
This prevents the process from correctly identifying the fault address and
handling the error.  From the user-space perspective, applications are
unaware that the limit has been reached and that the siginfo is
effectively 'corrupted'.  This can lead to unpredictable behavior and
crashes, as we observed with java applications.

Fix this by passing override_rlimit into inc_rlimit_get_ucounts() and skip
the comparison to max there if override_rlimit is set.  This effectively
restores the old behavior.",'-,5.5,258311,CentOS Stream Security update for kernel,4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 5, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,143153569,sppdmzcdi32v.czech.ch,"10.43.225.79,172.17.0.1,172.21.0.1","fe80:0:0:0:42:31ff:fec9:844,fe80:0:0:0:42:deff:fe5a:2bd7,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feb9:173b,fe80:0:0:0:480:55ff:fe40:96eb,fe80:0:0:0:c2c:ecff:fe3a:d396,fe80:0:0:0:10cb:8dff:fe11:a339,fe80:0:0:0:14a5:91ff:fe96:b026,fe80:0:0:0:302b:32ff:fea8:776c,fe80:0:0:0:30d4:35ff:fefa:885c,fe80:0:0:0:3882:1fff:fe4e:e634,fe80:0:0:0:40a9:22ff:feca:f823,fe80:0:0:0:40dc:67ff:feda:352,fe80:0:0:0:40e0:47ff:fef3:cdd1,fe80:0:0:0:4834:62ff:fef1:deea,fe80:0:0:0:6865:e8ff:fea0:a1a4,fe80:0:0:0:7047:42ff:fe12:62f7,fe80:0:0:0:704d:7fff:fef5:5c90,fe80:0:0:0:7856:6bff:fe76:8de6,fe80:0:0:0:78e3:57ff:fedc:944a,fe80:0:0:0:7cd5:c7ff:fec8:f0f1,fe80:0:0:0:8431:1bff:fe5a:327a,fe80:0:0:0:9016:6ff:fec1:5514,fe80:0:0:0:9849:9eff:fe3a:89f,fe80:0:0:0:98af:84ff:fe20:2397,fe80:0:0:0:a47e:6bff:fec2:2f77,fe80:0:0:0:bcdc:d9ff:fe64:6bf8,fe80:0:0:0:c491:2bff:fee5:5e00,fe80:0:0:0:c492:8eff:fe92:e354,fe80:0:0:0:cc4b:71ff:fe34:e0e2,fe80:0:0:0:cc76:7ff:feba:745d,fe80:0:0:0:e0b4:dbff:fe1c:a276",Refer to CentOS security advisory kernel for updates and patch information.(https://kojihub.stream.centos.org/koji/buildinfo?buildID=74602),"CH,Cloud Agent,All",No,No,'-,25,"Feb 5, 2025","Feb 4, 2025",CentOS,HIGH,High Lateral Movement,CentOS Stream 9,'-,'-,138,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",No,2,340,,"#table cols=""3""

implicitly through `usb_free_urb(dev->urb_intr)` with the
`URB_FREE_BUFFER` flag and again explicitly by `kfree(buf)`. This caused
a double free issue.

To resolve this, reordered `kmalloc()` and `usb_alloc_urb()` calls to
simplify the initialization sequence and removed the redundant
`kfree(buf)`.  Now, `buf` is allocated after `usb_alloc_urb()`, ensuring

CVE-2024-43882,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

exec: Fix ToCToU between perm check and set-uid/gid usage

When opening a file for exec via do_filp_open(), permission checking is
done against the file's metadata at that moment, and on success, a file
pointer is passed back. Much later in the execve() code path, the file
metadata (specifically mode, uid, and gid) is used to determine if/how
to set the uid and gid. However, those values may have changed since the
permissions check, meaning the execution may gain unintended privileges.

For example, if a file could change permissions from executable and not
set-id:

---------x 1 root root 16048 Aug  7 13:16 target

to set-id and non-executable:

---S------ 1 root root 16048 Aug  7 13:16 target

it is possible to gain root privileges when execution should have been
disallowed.

While this race condition is rare in real-world scenarios, it has been
observed (and proven exploitable) when package managers are updating
the setuid bits of installed programs. Such files start with being
world-executable but then are adjusted to be group-exec with a set-uid
bit. For example, ""chmod o-x,u+s target"" makes ""target"" executable only
by uid ""root"" and gid ""cdrom"", while also becoming setuid-root:

-rwxr-xr-x 1 root cdrom 16048 Aug  7 13:16 target

becomes:

-rwsr-xr-- 1 root cdrom 16048 Aug  7 13:16 target

But racing the chmod means users without group ""cdrom"" membership can
get the permission to execute ""target"" just before the chmod, and when
the chmod finishes, the exec reaches brpm_fill_uid(), and performs the
setuid to root, violating the expressed authorization of ""only cdrom
group members can setuid to root"".

Re-check that we still have execute permissions in case the metadata
has changed. It would be better to keep a copy from the perm-check time,

CVE-2024-57929,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dm array: fix releasing a faulty array block twice in dm_array_cursor_end

When dm_bm_read_lock() fails due to locking or checksum errors, it
releases the faulty block implicitly while leaving an invalid output
pointer behind. The caller of dm_bm_read_lock() should not operate on
this invalid dm_block pointer, or it will lead to undefined result.
For example, the dm_array_cursor incorrectly caches the invalid pointer
on reading a faulty array block, causing a double release in
dm_array_cursor_end(), then hitting the BUG_ON in dm-bufio cache_put().

Reproduce steps:

1. initialize a cache device

dmsetup create cmeta --table ""0 8192 linear /dev/sdc 0""
dmsetup create cdata --table ""0 65536 linear /dev/sdc 8192""
dmsetup create corig --table ""0 524288 linear /dev/sdc $262144""
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/mapper/cmeta bs=4k count=1
dmsetup create cache --table ""0 524288 cache /dev/mapper/cmeta \
/dev/mapper/cdata /dev/mapper/corig 128 2 metadata2 writethrough smq 0""

2. wipe the second array block offline

dmsteup remove cache cmeta cdata corig
mapping_root=$(dd if=/dev/sdc bs=1c count=8 skip=192 \
2>/dev/null | hexdump -e '1/8 ""%u\n""')
ablock=$(dd if=/dev/sdc bs=1c count=8 skip=$((4096*mapping_root+2056)) \
2>/dev/null | hexdump -e '1/8 ""%u\n""')
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdc bs=4k count=1 seek=$ablock

3. try reopen the cache device

dmsetup create cmeta --table ""0 8192 linear /dev/sdc 0""
dmsetup create cdata --table ""0 65536 linear /dev/sdc 8192""
dmsetup create corig --table ""0 524288 linear /dev/sdc $262144""
dmsetup create cache --table ""0 524288 cache /dev/mapper/cmeta \
/dev/mapper/cdata /dev/mapper/corig 128 2 metadata2 writethrough smq 0""

Fix by setting the cached block pointer to NULL on errors.

CVE-2024-56669,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommu/vt-d: Remove cache tags before disabling ATS

The current implementation removes cache tags after disabling ATS,
leading to potential memory leaks and kernel crashes. Specifically,
CACHE_TAG_DEVTLB type cache tags may still remain in the list even
after the domain is freed, causing a use-after-free condition.

This issue really shows up when multiple VFs from different PFs
passed through to a single user-space process via vfio-pci. In such
cases, the kernel may crash with kernel messages like:

CVE-2024-56568,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommu/arm-smmu: Defer probe of clients after smmu device bound

Null pointer dereference occurs due to a race between smmu
driver probe and client driver probe, when of_dma_configure()
for client is called after the iommu_device_register() for smmu driver
probe has executed but before the driver_bound() for smmu driver
has been called.

Following is how the race occurs:

T1:Smmu device probe		T2: Client device probe

really_probe()
arm_smmu_device_probe()
iommu_device_register()
					really_probe()
					platform_dma_configure()
					of_dma_configure()
					of_dma_configure_id()
					of_iommu_configure()
					iommu_probe_device()
					iommu_init_device()
					arm_smmu_probe_device()
					arm_smmu_get_by_fwnode()
						driver_find_device_by_fwnode()
						driver_find_device()
						next_device()
						klist_next()
						    /* null ptr
						       assigned to smmu */
					/* null ptr dereference
					   while smmu->streamid_mask */
driver_bound()
	klist_add_tail()

When this null smmu pointer is dereferenced later in
arm_smmu_probe_device, the device crashes.

Fix this by deferring the probe of the client device
until the smmu device has bound to the arm smmu driver.

CVE-2024-56668,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommu/vt-d: Fix qi_batch NULL pointer with nested parent domain

The qi_batch is allocated when assigning cache tag for a domain. While
for nested parent domain, it is missed. Hence, when trying to map pages
to the nested parent, NULL dereference occurred. Also, there is potential
memleak since there is no lock around domain->qi_batch allocation.

To solve it, add a helper for qi_batch allocation, and call it in both
the __cache_tag_assign_domain() and __cache_tag_assign_parent_domain().

CVE-2024-53232,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommu/s390: Implement blocking domain

This fixes a crash when surprise hot-unplugging a PCI device. This crash
happens because during hot-unplug __iommu_group_set_domain_nofail()
attaching the default domain fails when the platform no longer
recognizes the device as it has already been removed and we end up with
a NULL domain pointer and UAF. This is exactly the case referred to in
the second comment in __iommu_device_set_domain() and just as stated
there if we can instead attach the blocking domain the UAF is prevented
as this can handle the already removed device. Implement the blocking

CVE-2024-53142,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

initramfs: avoid filename buffer overrun

The initramfs filename field is defined in
Documentation/driver-api/early-userspace/buffer-format.rst as:

 37 cpio_file := ALGN(4) + cpio_header + filename + ""\0"" + ALGN(4) + data
...
 55 ============= ================== =========================
 56 Field name    Field size         Meaning
 57 ============= ================== =========================
...
 70 c_namesize    8 bytes            Length of filename, including final \0

When extracting an initramfs cpio archive, the kernel's do_name() path
handler assumes a zero-terminated path at @collected, passing it
directly to filp_open() / init_mkdir() / init_mknod().

If a specially crafted cpio entry carries a non-zero-terminated filename
and is followed by uninitialized memory, then a file may be created with
trailing characters that represent the uninitialized memory. The ability
to create an initramfs entry would imply already having full control of
the system, so the buffer overrun shouldn't be considered a security
vulnerability.

Append the output of the following bash script to an existing initramfs
and observe any created /initramfs_test_fname_overrunAA* path. E.g.
  ./reproducer.sh | gzip >> /myinitramfs

It's easiest to observe non-zero uninitialized memory when the output is
gzipped, as it'll overflow the heap allocated @out_buf in __gunzip(),
rather than the initrd_start+initrd_size block.

CVE-2024-56779,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nfsd: fix nfs4_openowner leak when concurrent nfsd4_open occur

The action force umount(umount -f) will attempt to kill all rpc_task even
umount operation may ultimately fail if some files remain open.
Consequently, if an action attempts to open a file, it can potentially
send two rpc_task to nfs server.

    nfs4_run_open_task
     /* rpc_task2 */
     rpc_run_task

While processing an open request, nfsd will first attempt to find or
allocate an nfs4_openowner. If it finds an nfs4_openowner that is not
marked as NFS4_OO_CONFIRMED, this nfs4_openowner will released. Since
two rpc_task can attempt to open the same file simultaneously from the
client to server, and because two instances of nfsd can run
concurrently, this situation can lead to lots of memory leak.
Additionally, when we echo 0 to /proc/fs/nfsd/threads, warning will be
triggered.

CVE-2024-47742,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

firmware_loader: Block path traversal

Most firmware names are hardcoded strings, or are constructed from fairly
constrained format strings where the dynamic parts are just some hex
numbers or such.

However, there are a couple codepaths in the kernel where firmware file
names contain string components that are passed through from a device or
semi-privileged userspace; the ones I could find (not counting interfaces
that require root privileges) are:

 - lpfc_sli4_request_firmware_update() seems to construct the firmware
   filename from ""ModelName"", a string that was previously parsed out of
   some descriptor (""Vital Product Data"") in lpfc_fill_vpd()
 - nfp_net_fw_find() seems to construct a firmware filename from a model
   name coming from nfp_hwinfo_lookup(pf->hwinfo, ""nffw.partno""), which I
   think parses some descriptor that was read from the device.
   (But this case likely isn't exploitable because the format string looks
   like ""netronome/nic_%s"", and there shouldn't be any *folders* starting
   with ""netronome/nic_"". The previous case was different because there,
   the ""%s"" is *at the start* of the format string.)
 - module_flash_fw_schedule() is reachable from the
   ETHTOOL_MSG_MODULE_FW_FLASH_ACT netlink command, which is marked as
   GENL_UNS_ADMIN_PERM (meaning CAP_NET_ADMIN inside a user namespace is
   enough to pass the privilege check), and takes a userspace-provided
   firmware name.
   (But I think to reach this case, you need to have CAP_NET_ADMIN over a
   network namespace that a special kind of ethernet device is mapped into,
   so I think this is not a viable attack path in practice.)

Fix it by rejecting any firmware names containing "".."" path components.

For what it's worth, I went looking and haven't found any USB device
drivers that use the firmware loader dangerously.",'-,7.8,358475,Amazon Linux Security Advisory for kernel : ALAS2-2025-2745,4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 5, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,197487608,ptaws-sv-wsgw1.portugal.pt,"10.64.192.69,172.17.0.1,172.18.0.1,172.19.0.1","fe80:0:0:0:42:b8ff:fe9a:17fa,fe80:0:0:0:866:55ff:fe39:6bb1,fe80:0:0:0:1cc4:92ff:fe11:8978","Please refer to Amazon advisory: ALAS2-2025-2745 for affected packages and patching details, or update with your package manager.(https://alas.aws.amazon.com/AL2/ALAS-2025-2745.html)","PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,35,25,"Feb 5, 2025","Jan 30, 2025",Amazon Linux,HIGH,High Lateral Movement,Amazon Linux 2,'-,'-,139,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a securitybreach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,46,,"#table cols=""3""

4. get the offset of `print_string()`
```
objdump -t test | grep -w print_string
0000000000401199 g     F .text  000000000000001b              print_string
```

5. configure uprobe with offset 0x1199
```
off=0x1199

cd /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/
echo ""p /root/test:${off} arg1=+0(%di):ustring arg2=\$comm arg3=+0(%di):ustring""
 > uprobe_events
echo 1 > events/uprobes/enable
echo 1 > tracing_on
```

6. run `test`, and kasan will report error.

net/ipv6: avoid possible UAF in ip6_route_mpath_notify()

syzbot found another use-after-free in ip6_route_mpath_notify() [1]

Commit f7225172f25a (""net/ipv6: prevent use after free in

We need to defer the fib6_info_release() calls after

CVE-2024-50230,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nilfs2: fix kernel bug due to missing clearing of checked flag

Syzbot reported that in directory operations after nilfs2 detects
filesystem corruption and degrades to read-only,
__block_write_begin_int(), which is called to prepare block writes, may
fail the BUG_ON check for accesses exceeding the folio/page size,
triggering a kernel bug.

This was found to be because the ""checked"" flag of a page/folio was not
cleared when it was discarded by nilfs2's own routine, which causes the
sanity check of directory entries to be skipped when the directory
page/folio is reloaded.  So, fix that.

This was necessary when the use of nilfs2's own page discard routine was
applied to more than just metadata files.",'-,7.8,358475,Amazon Linux Security Advisory for kernel : ALAS2-2025-2745,4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 5, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,197487608,ptaws-sv-wsgw1.portugal.pt,"10.64.192.69,172.17.0.1,172.18.0.1,172.19.0.1","fe80:0:0:0:42:b8ff:fe9a:17fa,fe80:0:0:0:866:55ff:fe39:6bb1,fe80:0:0:0:1cc4:92ff:fe11:8978","Please refer to Amazon advisory: ALAS2-2025-2745 for affected packages and patching details, or update with your package manager.(https://alas.aws.amazon.com/AL2/ALAS-2025-2745.html)","PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,35,25,"Feb 5, 2025","Jan 30, 2025",Amazon Linux,HIGH,High Lateral Movement,Amazon Linux 2,'-,'-,139,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a securitybreach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,46,,"#table cols=""3""

  ext4_ext_insert_extent(ppath)
    ext4_ext_create_new_leaf(ppath)
      ext4_find_extent(orig_path)

        ext4_free_ext_path(path)

  a. If err is -ENOMEM:
  ext4_ext_dirty(path + path->p_depth)
  // path use-after-free !!!
  b. If err is -EIO and we have EXT_DEBUG defined:
  ext4_ext_show_leaf(path)
    eh = path[depth].p_hdr
    // path also use-after-free !!!

So when trying to zeroout or fix the extent length, call ext4_find_extent()
to update the path.

In addition we use *ppath directly as an ext4_ext_show_leaf() input to
avoid possible use-after-free when EXT_DEBUG is defined, and to avoid
unnecessary path updates.",'-,7.8,358475,Amazon Linux Security Advisory for kernel : ALAS2-2025-2745,4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 5, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,197487608,ptaws-sv-wsgw1.portugal.pt,"10.64.192.69,172.17.0.1,172.18.0.1,172.19.0.1","fe80:0:0:0:42:b8ff:fe9a:17fa,fe80:0:0:0:866:55ff:fe39:6bb1,fe80:0:0:0:1cc4:92ff:fe11:8978","Please refer to Amazon advisory: ALAS2-2025-2745 for affected packages and patching details, or update with your package manager.(https://alas.aws.amazon.com/AL2/ALAS-2025-2745.html)","PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,35,25,"Feb 5, 2025","Jan 30, 2025",Amazon Linux,HIGH,High Lateral Movement,Amazon Linux 2,'-,'-,139,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a securitybreach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,46,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-11187,"It is possible to construct a zone such that some queries to it will generate responses containing numerous records in the Additional section.

CVE-2024-36899,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

gpiolib: cdev: Fix use after free in lineinfo_changed_notify

The use-after-free issue occurs as follows: when the GPIO chip device file
is being closed by invoking gpio_chrdev_release(), watched_lines is freed
by bitmap_free(), but the unregistration of lineinfo_changed_nb notifier
chain failed due to waiting write rwsem. Additionally, one of the GPIO
chip's lines is also in the release process and holds the notifier chain's
read rwsem. Consequently, a race condition leads to the use-after-free of
watched_lines.

Here is the typical stack when issue happened:

[free]
gpio_chrdev_release()
  --> bitmap_free(cdev->watched_lines)                  <-- freed
  --> blocking_notifier_chain_unregister()
    --> down_write(&nh->rwsem)                          <-- waiting rwsem
          --> __down_write_common()
            --> rwsem_down_write_slowpath()
                  --> schedule_preempt_disabled()
                    --> schedule()

[use]
st54spi_gpio_dev_release()
  --> gpio_free()
    --> gpiod_free()
      --> gpiod_free_commit()
        --> gpiod_line_state_notify()
          --> blocking_notifier_call_chain()
            --> down_read(&nh->rwsem);                  <-- held rwsem
            --> notifier_call_chain()
              --> lineinfo_changed_notify()
                --> test_bit(xxxx, cdev->watched_lines) <-- use after free

The side effect of the use-after-free issue is that a GPIO line event is
being generated for userspace where it shouldn't. However, since the chrdev
is being closed, userspace won't have the chance to read that event anyway.

To fix the issue, call the bitmap_free() function after the unregistration
of lineinfo_changed_nb notifier chain.",'-,7,358510,Amazon Linux Security Advisory for kernel : ALAS2023-2025-823,4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 7, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,197479260,ptaws-sv-mddrm1.portugal.pt,"10.64.192.107,172.17.0.1,172.18.0.1","fe80:0:0:0:42:73ff:fe98:d19a,fe80:0:0:0:886:edff:fe89:2bb9,fe80:0:0:0:90df:19ff:fee0:a8ff","Please refer to Amazon advisory: ALAS2023-2025-823 for affected packages and patching details, or update with your package manager.(https://alas.aws.amazon.com/AL2023/ALAS-2025-823.html)","PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,35,24,"Feb 6, 2025","Jan 30, 2025",Amazon Linux,HIGH,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit",Amazon Linux 2023.6.20241212,'-,'-,138,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a securitybreach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,153,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-50164,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Fix overloading of MEM_UNINIT's meaning

Lonial reported an issue in the BPF verifier where check_mem_size_reg()
has the following code:

    if (!tnum_is_const(reg->var_off))
        /* For unprivileged variable accesses, disable raw
         * mode so that the program is required to
         * initialize all the memory that the helper could
         * just partially fill up.
         */
         meta = NULL;

This means that writes are not checked when the register containing the
size of the passed buffer has not a fixed size. Through this bug, a BPF
program can write to a map which is marked as read-only, for example,
.rodata global maps.

The problem is that MEM_UNINIT's initial meaning that ""the passed buffer
to the BPF helper does not need to be initialized"" which was added back
in commit 435faee1aae9 (""bpf, verifier: add ARG_PTR_TO_RAW_STACK type"")
got overloaded over time with ""the passed buffer is being written to"".

The problem however is that checks such as the above which were added later
via 06c1c049721a (""bpf: allow helpers access to variable memory"") set meta
to NULL in order force the user to always initialize the passed buffer to
the helper. Due to the current double meaning of MEM_UNINIT, this bypasses
verifier write checks to the memory (not boundary checks though) and only
assumes the latter memory is read instead.

Fix this by reverting MEM_UNINIT back to its original meaning, and having
MEM_WRITE as an annotation to BPF helpers in order to then trigger the
BPF verifier checks for writing to memory.

Some notes: check_arg_pair_ok() ensures that for ARG_CONST_SIZE{,_OR_ZERO}
we can access fn->arg_type[arg - 1] since it must contain a preceding
ARG_PTR_TO_MEM. For check_mem_reg() the meta argument can be removed
altogether since we do check both BPF_READ and BPF_WRITE. Same for the
equivalent check_kfunc_mem_size_reg().",'-,7.1,358510,Amazon Linux Security Advisory for kernel : ALAS2023-2025-823,4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 7, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,197479260,ptaws-sv-mddrm1.portugal.pt,"10.64.192.107,172.17.0.1,172.18.0.1","fe80:0:0:0:42:73ff:fe98:d19a,fe80:0:0:0:886:edff:fe89:2bb9,fe80:0:0:0:90df:19ff:fee0:a8ff","Please refer to Amazon advisory: ALAS2023-2025-823 for affected packages and patching details, or update with your package manager.(https://alas.aws.amazon.com/AL2023/ALAS-2025-823.html)","PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,35,24,"Feb 6, 2025","Jan 30, 2025",Amazon Linux,HIGH,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit",Amazon Linux 2023.6.20241212,'-,'-,138,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a securitybreach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,153,,"#table cols=""3""

Specifically, the SSH protocol allows clients to inquire about whether a public key is acceptable before proving control of the corresponding private key. PublicKeyCallback may be called with multiple keys, and the order in which the keys were provided cannot be used to infer which key the client successfully authenticated with, if any. Some applications, which store the key(s) passed to PublicKeyCallback (or derived information) and make security relevant determinations based on it once the connection is established, may make incorrect assumptions. For example, an attacker may send public keys A and B, and then authenticate with A. PublicKeyCallback would be called only twice, first with A and then with B. A vulnerable application may then make authorization decisions based on key B for which the attacker does not actually control the private key. Since this API is widely misused, as a partial mitigation golang.org/x/cry...@v0.31.0 enforces the property that, when successfully authenticating via public key, the last key passed to ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback will be the key used to authenticate the connection. PublicKeyCallback will now be called multiple times with the same key, if necessary. Note that the client may still not control the last key passed to PublicKeyCallback if the connection is then authenticated with a different method, such as PasswordCallback, KeyboardInteractiveCallback, or NoClientAuth. Users should be using the Extensions field of the Permissions return value from the various authentication callbacks to record data associated with the authentication attempt instead of referencing external state. Once the connection is established the state corresponding to the successful authentication attempt can be retrieved via the ServerConn.Permissions field. Note that some third-party libraries misuse the Permissions type by sharing it across authentication attempts; users of third-party libraries should refer to the relevant projects for guidance.",'-,'-,358491,Amazon Linux Security Advisory for containerd : ALAS2023-2025-835,4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 7, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,197479260,ptaws-sv-mddrm1.portugal.pt,"10.64.192.107,172.17.0.1,172.18.0.1","fe80:0:0:0:42:73ff:fe98:d19a,fe80:0:0:0:886:edff:fe89:2bb9,fe80:0:0:0:90df:19ff:fee0:a8ff","Please refer to Amazon advisory: ALAS2023-2025-835 for affected packages and patching details, or update with your package manager.(https://alas.aws.amazon.com/AL2023/ALAS-2025-835.html)","PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,72,24,"Feb 6, 2025","Jan 30, 2025",Amazon Linux,CRITICAL,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit",Amazon Linux 2023.6.20241212,'-,'-,138,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a securitybreach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,153,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-8508,"NLnet Labs Unbound up to and including version 1.21.0 contains a vulnerability when handling replies with very large RRsets that it needs to perform name compression for. Malicious upstreams responses with very large RRsets can cause Unbound to spend a considerable time applying name compression to downstream replies. This can lead to degraded performance and eventually denial of service in well orchestrated attacks. The vulnerability can be exploited by a malicious actor querying Unbound for the specially crafted contents of a malicious zone with very large RRsets. Before Unbound replies to the query it will try to apply name compression which was an unbounded operation that could lock the CPU until the whole packet was complete. Unbound version 1.21.1 introduces a hard limit on the number of name compression calculations it is willing to do per packet.

CVE-2024-36899,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

gpiolib: cdev: Fix use after free in lineinfo_changed_notify

The use-after-free issue occurs as follows: when the GPIO chip device file
is being closed by invoking gpio_chrdev_release(), watched_lines is freed
by bitmap_free(), but the unregistration of lineinfo_changed_nb notifier
chain failed due to waiting write rwsem. Additionally, one of the GPIO
chip's lines is also in the release process and holds the notifier chain's
read rwsem. Consequently, a race condition leads to the use-after-free of
watched_lines.

Here is the typical stack when issue happened:

[free]
gpio_chrdev_release()
  --> bitmap_free(cdev->watched_lines)                  <-- freed
  --> blocking_notifier_chain_unregister()
    --> down_write(&nh->rwsem)                          <-- waiting rwsem
          --> __down_write_common()
            --> rwsem_down_write_slowpath()
                  --> schedule_preempt_disabled()
                    --> schedule()

[use]
st54spi_gpio_dev_release()
  --> gpio_free()
    --> gpiod_free()
      --> gpiod_free_commit()
        --> gpiod_line_state_notify()
          --> blocking_notifier_call_chain()
            --> down_read(&nh->rwsem);                  <-- held rwsem
            --> notifier_call_chain()
              --> lineinfo_changed_notify()
                --> test_bit(xxxx, cdev->watched_lines) <-- use after free

The side effect of the use-after-free issue is that a GPIO line event is
being generated for userspace where it shouldn't. However, since the chrdev
is being closed, userspace won't have the chance to read that event anyway.

To fix the issue, call the bitmap_free() function after the unregistration
of lineinfo_changed_nb notifier chain.",'-,7,358510,Amazon Linux Security Advisory for kernel : ALAS2023-2025-823,4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 7, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,197480041,ptaws-sv-orth01.portugal.pt,"10.64.192.204,172.17.0.1,172.18.0.1","fe80:0:0:0:42:4bff:fe14:b556,fe80:0:0:0:8a7:e2ff:fe53:ac31,fe80:0:0:0:7072:edff:fefc:3bfa","Please refer to Amazon advisory: ALAS2023-2025-823 for affected packages and patching details, or update with your package manager.(https://alas.aws.amazon.com/AL2023/ALAS-2025-823.html)","PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,35,24,"Feb 6, 2025","Jan 30, 2025",Amazon Linux,HIGH,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit",Amazon Linux 2023.6.20250211,'-,'-,134,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a securitybreach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,13,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-50164,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Fix overloading of MEM_UNINIT's meaning

Lonial reported an issue in the BPF verifier where check_mem_size_reg()
has the following code:

    if (!tnum_is_const(reg->var_off))
        /* For unprivileged variable accesses, disable raw
         * mode so that the program is required to
         * initialize all the memory that the helper could
         * just partially fill up.
         */
         meta = NULL;

This means that writes are not checked when the register containing the
size of the passed buffer has not a fixed size. Through this bug, a BPF
program can write to a map which is marked as read-only, for example,
.rodata global maps.

The problem is that MEM_UNINIT's initial meaning that ""the passed buffer
to the BPF helper does not need to be initialized"" which was added back
in commit 435faee1aae9 (""bpf, verifier: add ARG_PTR_TO_RAW_STACK type"")
got overloaded over time with ""the passed buffer is being written to"".

The problem however is that checks such as the above which were added later
via 06c1c049721a (""bpf: allow helpers access to variable memory"") set meta
to NULL in order force the user to always initialize the passed buffer to
the helper. Due to the current double meaning of MEM_UNINIT, this bypasses
verifier write checks to the memory (not boundary checks though) and only
assumes the latter memory is read instead.

Fix this by reverting MEM_UNINIT back to its original meaning, and having
MEM_WRITE as an annotation to BPF helpers in order to then trigger the
BPF verifier checks for writing to memory.

Some notes: check_arg_pair_ok() ensures that for ARG_CONST_SIZE{,_OR_ZERO}
we can access fn->arg_type[arg - 1] since it must contain a preceding

CVE-2024-57929,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dm array: fix releasing a faulty array block twice in dm_array_cursor_end

When dm_bm_read_lock() fails due to locking or checksum errors, it
releases the faulty block implicitly while leaving an invalid output
pointer behind. The caller of dm_bm_read_lock() should not operate on
this invalid dm_block pointer, or it will lead to undefined result.
For example, the dm_array_cursor incorrectly caches the invalid pointer
on reading a faulty array block, causing a double release in
dm_array_cursor_end(), then hitting the BUG_ON in dm-bufio cache_put().

Reproduce steps:

1. initialize a cache device

dmsetup create cmeta --table ""0 8192 linear /dev/sdc 0""
dmsetup create cdata --table ""0 65536 linear /dev/sdc 8192""
dmsetup create corig --table ""0 524288 linear /dev/sdc $262144""
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/mapper/cmeta bs=4k count=1
dmsetup create cache --table ""0 524288 cache /dev/mapper/cmeta \
/dev/mapper/cdata /dev/mapper/corig 128 2 metadata2 writethrough smq 0""

2. wipe the second array block offline

dmsteup remove cache cmeta cdata corig
mapping_root=$(dd if=/dev/sdc bs=1c count=8 skip=192 \
2>/dev/null | hexdump -e '1/8 ""%u\n""')
ablock=$(dd if=/dev/sdc bs=1c count=8 skip=$((4096*mapping_root+2056)) \
2>/dev/null | hexdump -e '1/8 ""%u\n""')
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdc bs=4k count=1 seek=$ablock

3. try reopen the cache device

dmsetup create cmeta --table ""0 8192 linear /dev/sdc 0""
dmsetup create cdata --table ""0 65536 linear /dev/sdc 8192""
dmsetup create corig --table ""0 524288 linear /dev/sdc $262144""

CVE-2024-56669,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommu/vt-d: Remove cache tags before disabling ATS

The current implementation removes cache tags after disabling ATS,
leading to potential memory leaks and kernel crashes. Specifically,
CACHE_TAG_DEVTLB type cache tags may still remain in the list even
after the domain is freed, causing a use-after-free condition.

This issue really shows up when multiple VFs from different PFs
passed through to a single user-space process via vfio-pci. In such
cases, the kernel may crash with kernel messages like:

CVE-2024-56568,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommu/arm-smmu: Defer probe of clients after smmu device bound

Null pointer dereference occurs due to a race between smmu
driver probe and client driver probe, when of_dma_configure()
for client is called after the iommu_device_register() for smmu driver
probe has executed but before the driver_bound() for smmu driver
has been called.

Following is how the race occurs:

T1:Smmu device probe		T2: Client device probe

really_probe()
arm_smmu_device_probe()
iommu_device_register()
					really_probe()
					platform_dma_configure()
					of_dma_configure()
					of_dma_configure_id()
					of_iommu_configure()
					iommu_probe_device()
					iommu_init_device()
					arm_smmu_probe_device()
					arm_smmu_get_by_fwnode()

						    /* null ptr
						       assigned to smmu */
					/* null ptr dereference
					   while smmu->streamid_mask */
driver_bound()
	klist_add_tail()

When this null smmu pointer is dereferenced later in
arm_smmu_probe_device, the device crashes.

Fix this by deferring the probe of the client device
until the smmu device has bound to the arm smmu driver.

iommu/vt-d: Fix qi_batch NULL pointer with nested parent domain

The qi_batch is allocated when assigning cache tag for a domain. While
for nested parent domain, it is missed. Hence, when trying to map pages
to the nested parent, NULL dereference occurred. Also, there is potential
memleak since there is no lock around domain->qi_batch allocation.

To solve it, add a helper for qi_batch allocation, and call it in both
the __cache_tag_assign_domain() and __cache_tag_assign_parent_domain().

CVE-2024-53142,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

initramfs: avoid filename buffer overrun

The initramfs filename field is defined in
Documentation/driver-api/early-userspace/buffer-format.rst as:

 37 cpio_file := ALGN(4) + cpio_header + filename + ""\0"" + ALGN(4) + data
...
 55 ============= ================== =========================
 56 Field name    Field size         Meaning
 57 ============= ================== =========================
...
 70 c_namesize    8 bytes            Length of filename, including final \0

When extracting an initramfs cpio archive, the kernel's do_name() path
handler assumes a zero-terminated path at @collected, passing it
directly to filp_open() / init_mkdir() / init_mknod().

If a specially crafted cpio entry carries a non-zero-terminated filename
and is followed by uninitialized memory, then a file may be created with
trailing characters that represent the uninitialized memory. The ability
to create an initramfs entry would imply already having full control of
the system, so the buffer overrun shouldn't be considered a security
vulnerability.

Append the output of the following bash script to an existing initramfs
and observe any created /initramfs_test_fname_overrunAA* path. E.g.
  ./reproducer.sh | gzip >> /myinitramfs

It's easiest to observe non-zero uninitialized memory when the output is
gzipped, as it'll overflow the heap allocated @out_buf in __gunzip(),
rather than the initrd_start+initrd_size block.

CVE-2024-56779,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nfsd: fix nfs4_openowner leak when concurrent nfsd4_open occur

The action force umount(umount -f) will attempt to kill all rpc_task even
umount operation may ultimately fail if some files remain open.
Consequently, if an action attempts to open a file, it can potentially
send two rpc_task to nfs server.

                   NFS CLIENT

     rpc_run_task
     rpc_wait_for_completion_task

                                    nfs_umount_begin

    ...
    nfs4_run_open_task
     /* rpc_task2 */
     rpc_run_task
     rpc_wait_for_completion_task

While processing an open request, nfsd will first attempt to find or
allocate an nfs4_openowner. If it finds an nfs4_openowner that is not
marked as NFS4_OO_CONFIRMED, this nfs4_openowner will released. Since
two rpc_task can attempt to open the same file simultaneously from the
client to server, and because two instances of nfsd can run
concurrently, this situation can lead to lots of memory leak.
Additionally, when we echo 0 to /proc/fs/nfsd/threads, warning will be
triggered.

CVE-2024-50271,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

signal: restore the override_rlimit logic

Prior to commit d64696905554 (""Reimplement RLIMIT_SIGPENDING on top of
ucounts"") UCOUNT_RLIMIT_SIGPENDING rlimit was not enforced for a class of
signals.  However now it's enforced unconditionally, even if
override_rlimit is set.  This behavior change caused production issues.  

For example, if the limit is reached and a process receives a SIGSEGV
signal, sigqueue_alloc fails to allocate the necessary resources for the
signal delivery, preventing the signal from being delivered with siginfo. 
This prevents the process from correctly identifying the fault address and
handling the error.  From the user-space perspective, applications are
unaware that the limit has been reached and that the siginfo is
effectively 'corrupted'.  This can lead to unpredictable behavior and
crashes, as we observed with java applications.

Fix this by passing override_rlimit into inc_rlimit_get_ucounts() and skip
the comparison to max there if override_rlimit is set.  This effectively
restores the old behavior.",'-,5.5,258311,CentOS Stream Security update for kernel,4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 5, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,143139103,sppdmzcdi17v.czech.ch,10.43.225.90,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:fe8b:84ff,Refer to CentOS security advisory kernel for updates and patch information.(https://kojihub.stream.centos.org/koji/buildinfo?buildID=74602),"CH,Cloud Agent,All",No,No,'-,25,"Feb 5, 2025","Feb 4, 2025",CentOS,HIGH,High Lateral Movement,CentOS Stream 9,'-,'-,140,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",No,2,338,,"#table cols=""3""

net: usb: lan78xx: Fix double free issue with interrupt buffer allocation

In lan78xx_probe(), the buffer `buf` was being freed twice: once
implicitly through `usb_free_urb(dev->urb_intr)` with the
`URB_FREE_BUFFER` flag and again explicitly by `kfree(buf)`. This caused
a double free issue.

To resolve this, reordered `kmalloc()` and `usb_alloc_urb()` calls to
simplify the initialization sequence and removed the redundant
`kfree(buf)`.  Now, `buf` is allocated after `usb_alloc_urb()`, ensuring
it is correctly managed by  `usb_fill_int_urb()` and freed by

CVE-2024-43882,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

exec: Fix ToCToU between perm check and set-uid/gid usage

When opening a file for exec via do_filp_open(), permission checking is
done against the file's metadata at that moment, and on success, a file
pointer is passed back. Much later in the execve() code path, the file
metadata (specifically mode, uid, and gid) is used to determine if/how
to set the uid and gid. However, those values may have changed since the
permissions check, meaning the execution may gain unintended privileges.

For example, if a file could change permissions from executable and not
set-id:

---------x 1 root root 16048 Aug  7 13:16 target

to set-id and non-executable:

---S------ 1 root root 16048 Aug  7 13:16 target

it is possible to gain root privileges when execution should have been
disallowed.

While this race condition is rare in real-world scenarios, it has been
observed (and proven exploitable) when package managers are updating
the setuid bits of installed programs. Such files start with being
world-executable but then are adjusted to be group-exec with a set-uid
bit. For example, ""chmod o-x,u+s target"" makes ""target"" executable only
by uid ""root"" and gid ""cdrom"", while also becoming setuid-root:

-rwxr-xr-x 1 root cdrom 16048 Aug  7 13:16 target

becomes:

-rwsr-xr-- 1 root cdrom 16048 Aug  7 13:16 target

But racing the chmod means users without group ""cdrom"" membership can
get the permission to execute ""target"" just before the chmod, and when
the chmod finishes, the exec reaches brpm_fill_uid(), and performs the
setuid to root, violating the expressed authorization of ""only cdrom
group members can setuid to root"".

Re-check that we still have execute permissions in case the metadata
has changed. It would be better to keep a copy from the perm-check time,
but until we can do that refactoring, the least-bad option is to do a
full inode_permission() call (under inode lock). It is understood that
this is safe against dead-locks, but hardly optimal.",'-,7,258311,CentOS Stream Security update for kernel,4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 5, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,143139103,sppdmzcdi17v.czech.ch,10.43.225.90,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:fe8b:84ff,Refer to CentOS security advisory kernel for updates and patch information.(https://kojihub.stream.centos.org/koji/buildinfo?buildID=74602),"CH,Cloud Agent,All",No,No,35,25,"Feb 5, 2025","Feb 4, 2025",CentOS,HIGH,High Lateral Movement,CentOS Stream 9,'-,'-,140,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",No,2,338,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-50067,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

uprobe: avoid out-of-bounds memory access of fetching args

Uprobe needs to fetch args into a percpu buffer, and then copy to ring
buffer to avoid non-atomic context problem.

Sometimes user-space strings, arrays can be very large, but the size of
percpu buffer is only page size. And store_trace_args() won't check
whether these data exceeds a single page or not, caused out-of-bounds
memory access.

It could be reproduced by following steps:
1. build kernel with CONFIG_KASAN enabled
2. save follow program as test.c

```
\#include <stdio.h>
\#include <stdlib.h>
\#include <string.h>

// If string length large than MAX_STRING_SIZE, the fetch_store_strlen()
// will return 0, cause __get_data_size() return shorter size, and
// store_trace_args() will not trigger out-of-bounds access.
// So make string length less than 4096.
\#define STRLEN 4093

void generate_string(char *str, int n)
{
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i < n; ++i)
    {
        char c = i % 26 + 'a';
        str[i] = c;
    }
    str[n-1] = '\0';
}

void print_string(char *str)
{
    printf(""%s\n"", str);
}

int main()
{
    char tmp[STRLEN];

    generate_string(tmp, STRLEN);
    print_string(tmp);

    return 0;
}
```
3. compile program
`gcc -o test test.c`

4. get the offset of `print_string()`
```
objdump -t test | grep -w print_string
0000000000401199 g     F .text  000000000000001b              print_string
```

5. configure uprobe with offset 0x1199
```
off=0x1199

cd /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/
echo ""p /root/test:${off} arg1=+0(%di):ustring arg2=\$comm arg3=+0(%di):ustring""
 > uprobe_events
echo 1 > events/uprobes/enable
echo 1 > tracing_on
```

6. run `test`, and kasan will report error.

CVE-2024-21302,"Summary:
Microsoft was notified that an elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in Windows based systems supporting Virtualization Based Security (VBS), including a subset of Azure Virtual Machine SKUS. This vulnerability enables an attacker with administrator privileges to replace current versions of Windows system files with outdated versions. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker could reintroduce previously mitigated vulnerabilities, circumvent some features of VBS, and exfiltrate data protected by VBS.
Microsoft is developing a security update to mitigate this threat, but it is not yet available. Guidance to help customers reduce the risks associated with this vulnerability and to protect their systems until the mitigation is available in a Windows security update is provided in the Recommended Actions section of this CVE.
This CVE will be updated when the mitigation is available in a Windows security update. We highly encourage customers to subscribe to Security Update Guide notifications to receive an alert when this update occurs.
Update: August 13, 2024
Microsoft has released the August 2024 security updates that include an opt-in revocation policy mitigation to address this vulnerability. Customers running affected versions of Windows are encouraged to review KB5042562: Guidance for blocking rollback of virtualization-based security related updates to assess if this opt-in policy meets the needs of their environment before implementing this mitigation. There are risks associated with this mitigation that should be understood prior to applying it to your systems. Detailed information about these risks is also available in KB5042562.
Details:
A security researcher informed Microsoft of an elevation of privilege vulnerability in Windows 10, Windows 11, Windows Server 2016, and higher based systems including Azure Virtual Machines (VM) that support VBS. For more information on Windows versions and VM SKUs supporting VBS, reference: Virtualization-based Security (VBS) | Microsoft Learn.
The vulnerability enables an attacker with administrator privileges on the target system to replace current Windows system files with outdated versions.

CVE-2013-3900,"Why is Microsoft republishing a CVE from 2013?
We are republishing CVE-2013-3900 in the Security Update Guide to update the Security Updates table and to inform customers that the EnableCertPaddingCheck is available in all currently supported versions of Windows 10 and Windows 11. While the format is different from the original CVE published in 2013, except for clarifications about how to configure the EnableCertPaddingCheck registry value, the information herein remains unchanged from the original text published on December 10, 2013,
Microsoft does not plan to enforce the stricter verification behavior as a default functionality on supported releases of Microsoft Windows. This behavior remains available as an opt-in feature via reg key setting, and is available on supported editions of Windows released since December 10, 2013. This includes all currently supported versions of Windows 10 and Windows 11. The supporting code for this reg key was incorporated at the time of release for Windows 10 and Windows 11, so no security update is required; however, the reg key must be set. See the Security Updates table for the list of affected software.
Vulnerability Description
A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that the WinVerifyTrust function handles Windows Authenticode signature verification for portable executable (PE) files. An anonymous attacker could exploit the vulnerability by modifying an existing signed executable file to leverage unverified portions of the file in such a way as to add malicious code to the file without invalidating the signature. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.
If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
Exploitation of this vulnerability requires that a user or application run or install a specially crafted, signed PE file. An attacker could modify an...

CVE-2024-8508,"NLnet Labs Unbound up to and including version 1.21.0 contains a vulnerability when handling replies with very large RRsets that it needs to perform name compression for. Malicious upstreams responses with very large RRsets can cause Unbound to spend a considerable time applying name compression to downstream replies. This can lead to degraded performance and eventually denial of service in well orchestrated attacks. The vulnerability can be exploited by a malicious actor querying Unbound for the specially crafted contents of a malicious zone with very large RRsets. Before Unbound replies to the query it will try to apply name compression which was an unbounded operation that could lock the CPU until the whole packet was complete. Unbound version 1.21.1 introduces a hard limit on the number of name compression calculations it is willing to do per packet. Packets that need more compression will result in semi-compressed packets or truncated packets, even on TCP for huge messages, to avoid locking the CPU for long.

signal: restore the override_rlimit logic

Prior to commit d64696905554 (""Reimplement RLIMIT_SIGPENDING on top of
ucounts"") UCOUNT_RLIMIT_SIGPENDING rlimit was not enforced for a class of
signals.  However now it's enforced unconditionally, even if
override_rlimit is set.  This behavior change caused production issues.  

For example, if the limit is reached and a process receives a SIGSEGV
signal, sigqueue_alloc fails to allocate the necessary resources for the
signal delivery, preventing the signal from being delivered with siginfo. 
This prevents the process from correctly identifying the fault address and
handling the error.  From the user-space perspective, applications are
unaware that the limit has been reached and that the siginfo is
effectively 'corrupted'.  This can lead to unpredictable behavior and
crashes, as we observed with java applications.

Fix this by passing override_rlimit into inc_rlimit_get_ucounts() and skip
the comparison to max there if override_rlimit is set.  This effectively
restores the old behavior.",'-,5.5,258311,CentOS Stream Security update for kernel,4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 5, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,257750685,srvunielk11v.czech.ch,10.43.217.217,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feb9:9e3f,Refer to CentOS security advisory kernel for updates and patch information.(https://kojihub.stream.centos.org/koji/buildinfo?buildID=74602),"CH,Cloud Agent,All",No,No,'-,25,"Feb 5, 2025","Feb 4, 2025",CentOS,HIGH,High Lateral Movement,CentOS Stream 9,'-,'-,138,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",No,2,339,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-43882,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

exec: Fix ToCToU between perm check and set-uid/gid usage

When opening a file for exec via do_filp_open(), permission checking is
done against the file's metadata at that moment, and on success, a file
pointer is passed back. Much later in the execve() code path, the file
metadata (specifically mode, uid, and gid) is used to determine if/how
to set the uid and gid. However, those values may have changed since the
permissions check, meaning the execution may gain unintended privileges.

For example, if a file could change permissions from executable and not
set-id:

---------x 1 root root 16048 Aug  7 13:16 target

to set-id and non-executable:

---S------ 1 root root 16048 Aug  7 13:16 target

it is possible to gain root privileges when execution should have been
disallowed.

While this race condition is rare in real-world scenarios, it has been
observed (and proven exploitable) when package managers are updating
the setuid bits of installed programs. Such files start with being
world-executable but then are adjusted to be group-exec with a set-uid
bit. For example, ""chmod o-x,u+s target"" makes ""target"" executable only
by uid ""root"" and gid ""cdrom"", while also becoming setuid-root:

-rwxr-xr-x 1 root cdrom 16048 Aug  7 13:16 target

becomes:

-rwsr-xr-- 1 root cdrom 16048 Aug  7 13:16 target

But racing the chmod means users without group ""cdrom"" membership can
get the permission to execute ""target"" just before the chmod, and when
the chmod finishes, the exec reaches brpm_fill_uid(), and performs the
setuid to root, violating the expressed authorization of ""only cdrom
group members can setuid to root"".

Re-check that we still have execute permissions in case the metadata
has changed. It would be better to keep a copy from the perm-check time,
but until we can do that refactoring, the least-bad option is to do a
full inode_permission() call (under inode lock). It is understood that
this is safe against dead-locks, but hardly optimal.",'-,7,258311,CentOS Stream Security update for kernel,4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 5, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,257750685,srvunielk11v.czech.ch,10.43.217.217,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feb9:9e3f,Refer to CentOS security advisory kernel for updates and patch information.(https://kojihub.stream.centos.org/koji/buildinfo?buildID=74602),"CH,Cloud Agent,All",No,No,35,25,"Feb 5, 2025","Feb 4, 2025",CentOS,HIGH,High Lateral Movement,CentOS Stream 9,'-,'-,138,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",No,2,339,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-53142,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

initramfs: avoid filename buffer overrun

The initramfs filename field is defined in
Documentation/driver-api/early-userspace/buffer-format.rst as:

 37 cpio_file := ALGN(4) + cpio_header + filename + ""\0"" + ALGN(4) + data
...
 55 ============= ================== =========================
 56 Field name    Field size         Meaning
 57 ============= ================== =========================
...
 70 c_namesize    8 bytes            Length of filename, including final \0

When extracting an initramfs cpio archive, the kernel's do_name() path
handler assumes a zero-terminated path at @collected, passing it
directly to filp_open() / init_mkdir() / init_mknod().

If a specially crafted cpio entry carries a non-zero-terminated filename
and is followed by uninitialized memory, then a file may be created with
trailing characters that represent the uninitialized memory. The ability
to create an initramfs entry would imply already having full control of
the system, so the buffer overrun shouldn't be considered a security
vulnerability.

Append the output of the following bash script to an existing initramfs
and observe any created /initramfs_test_fname_overrunAA* path. E.g.
  ./reproducer.sh | gzip >> /myinitramfs

It's easiest to observe non-zero uninitialized memory when the output is
gzipped, as it'll overflow the heap allocated @out_buf in __gunzip(),
rather than the initrd_start+initrd_size block.

CVE-2024-56779,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nfsd: fix nfs4_openowner leak when concurrent nfsd4_open occur

The action force umount(umount -f) will attempt to kill all rpc_task even
umount operation may ultimately fail if some files remain open.
Consequently, if an action attempts to open a file, it can potentially
send two rpc_task to nfs server.

                   NFS CLIENT

                                    nfs_umount_begin
                                     rpc_killall_tasks

    ...
    nfs4_run_open_task
     /* rpc_task2 */
     rpc_run_task
     rpc_wait_for_completion_task

While processing an open request, nfsd will first attempt to find or
allocate an nfs4_openowner. If it finds an nfs4_openowner that is not
marked as NFS4_OO_CONFIRMED, this nfs4_openowner will released. Since
two rpc_task can attempt to open the same file simultaneously from the
client to server, and because two instances of nfsd can run
concurrently, this situation can lead to lots of memory leak.
Additionally, when we echo 0 to /proc/fs/nfsd/threads, warning will be
triggered.

CVE-2024-57929,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dm array: fix releasing a faulty array block twice in dm_array_cursor_end

When dm_bm_read_lock() fails due to locking or checksum errors, it
releases the faulty block implicitly while leaving an invalid output
pointer behind. The caller of dm_bm_read_lock() should not operate on
this invalid dm_block pointer, or it will lead to undefined result.
For example, the dm_array_cursor incorrectly caches the invalid pointer
on reading a faulty array block, causing a double release in
dm_array_cursor_end(), then hitting the BUG_ON in dm-bufio cache_put().

Reproduce steps:

1. initialize a cache device

dmsetup create cmeta --table ""0 8192 linear /dev/sdc 0""
dmsetup create cdata --table ""0 65536 linear /dev/sdc 8192""
dmsetup create corig --table ""0 524288 linear /dev/sdc $262144""
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/mapper/cmeta bs=4k count=1
dmsetup create cache --table ""0 524288 cache /dev/mapper/cmeta \
/dev/mapper/cdata /dev/mapper/corig 128 2 metadata2 writethrough smq 0""

2. wipe the second array block offline

dmsteup remove cache cmeta cdata corig
mapping_root=$(dd if=/dev/sdc bs=1c count=8 skip=192 \
2>/dev/null | hexdump -e '1/8 ""%u\n""')
ablock=$(dd if=/dev/sdc bs=1c count=8 skip=$((4096*mapping_root+2056)) \
2>/dev/null | hexdump -e '1/8 ""%u\n""')
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdc bs=4k count=1 seek=$ablock

3. try reopen the cache device

dmsetup create cmeta --table ""0 8192 linear /dev/sdc 0""
dmsetup create cdata --table ""0 65536 linear /dev/sdc 8192""
dmsetup create corig --table ""0 524288 linear /dev/sdc $262144""

CVE-2024-56568,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommu/arm-smmu: Defer probe of clients after smmu device bound

Null pointer dereference occurs due to a race between smmu
driver probe and client driver probe, when of_dma_configure()
for client is called after the iommu_device_register() for smmu driver
probe has executed but before the driver_bound() for smmu driver
has been called.

Following is how the race occurs:

T1:Smmu device probe		T2: Client device probe

really_probe()
arm_smmu_device_probe()
iommu_device_register()
					really_probe()
					platform_dma_configure()
					of_dma_configure()
					of_dma_configure_id()
					of_iommu_configure()
					iommu_probe_device()
					iommu_init_device()
					arm_smmu_probe_device()
					arm_smmu_get_by_fwnode()
						driver_find_device_by_fwnode()
						driver_find_device()
						next_device()
						klist_next()
						    /* null ptr
						       assigned to smmu */
					/* null ptr dereference
					   while smmu->streamid_mask */
driver_bound()
	klist_add_tail()

When this null smmu pointer is dereferenced later in
arm_smmu_probe_device, the device crashes.

CVE-2024-56668,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommu/vt-d: Fix qi_batch NULL pointer with nested parent domain

The qi_batch is allocated when assigning cache tag for a domain. While
for nested parent domain, it is missed. Hence, when trying to map pages
to the nested parent, NULL dereference occurred. Also, there is potential
memleak since there is no lock around domain->qi_batch allocation.

To solve it, add a helper for qi_batch allocation, and call it in both
the __cache_tag_assign_domain() and __cache_tag_assign_parent_domain().

CVE-2024-53232,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommu/s390: Implement blocking domain

This fixes a crash when surprise hot-unplugging a PCI device. This crash
happens because during hot-unplug __iommu_group_set_domain_nofail()
attaching the default domain fails when the platform no longer
recognizes the device as it has already been removed and we end up with
a NULL domain pointer and UAF. This is exactly the case referred to in
the second comment in __iommu_device_set_domain() and just as stated
there if we can instead attach the blocking domain the UAF is prevented
as this can handle the already removed device. Implement the blocking
domain to use this handling.  With this change, the crash is fixed but
we still hit a warning attempting to change DMA ownership on a blocked
device.",'-,5.5,258307,CentOS Stream Security update for kernel,4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 3, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,257750685,srvunielk11v.czech.ch,10.43.217.217,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feb9:9e3f,Refer to CentOS security advisory kernel for updates and patch information.(https://kojihub.stream.centos.org/koji/buildinfo?buildID=74537),"CH,Cloud Agent,All",No,No,30,27,"Feb 3, 2025","Jan 31, 2025",CentOS,HIGH,High Lateral Movement,CentOS Stream 9,'-,'-,150,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",No,2,339,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2013-3900,"Why is Microsoft republishing a CVE from 2013?
We are republishing CVE-2013-3900 in the Security Update Guide to update the Security Updates table and to inform customers that the EnableCertPaddingCheck is available in all currently supported versions of Windows 10 and Windows 11. While the format is different from the original CVE published in 2013, except for clarifications about how to configure the EnableCertPaddingCheck registry value, the information herein remains unchanged from the original text published on December 10, 2013,
Microsoft does not plan to enforce the stricter verification behavior as a default functionality on supported releases of Microsoft Windows. This behavior remains available as an opt-in feature via reg key setting, and is available on supported editions of Windows released since December 10, 2013. This includes all currently supported versions of Windows 10 and Windows 11. The supporting code for this reg key was incorporated at the time of release for Windows 10 and Windows 11, so no security update is required; however, the reg key must be set. See the Security Updates table for the list of affected software.
Vulnerability Description
A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that the WinVerifyTrust function handles Windows Authenticode signature verification for portable executable (PE) files. An anonymous attacker could exploit the vulnerability by modifying an existing signed executable file to leverage unverified portions of the file in such a way as to add malicious code to the file without invalidating the signature. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.
If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
Exploitation of this vulnerability requires that a user or application run or install a specially crafted, signed PE file. An attacker could modify an...
