CVE-2025-0714,"The vulnerability exists in the password storage of Mobateks MobaXterm in versions below 25.0.

CVE-2024-53052,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

io_uring/rw: fix missing NOWAIT check for O_DIRECT start write

When io_uring starts a write, it'll call kiocb_start_write() to bump the
super block rwsem, preventing any freezes from happening while that
write is in-flight. The freeze side will grab that rwsem for writing,
excluding any new writers from happening and waiting for existing writes
to finish. But io_uring unconditionally uses kiocb_start_write(), which
will block if someone is currently attempting to freeze the mount point.
This causes a deadlock where freeze is waiting for previous writes to
complete, but the previous writes cannot complete, as the task that is
supposed to complete them is blocked waiting on starting a new write.
This results in the following stuck trace showing that dependency with
the write blocked starting a new write:

Fix this by having the io_uring side honor IOCB_NOWAIT, and only attempt a
blocking grab of the super block rwsem if it isn't set. For normal issue
where IOCB_NOWAIT would always be set, this returns -EAGAIN which will
have io_uring core issue a blocking attempt of the write. That will in

CVE-2024-50182,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

secretmem: disable memfd_secret() if arch cannot set direct map

Return -ENOSYS from memfd_secret() syscall if !can_set_direct_map().  This
is the case for example on some arm64 configurations, where marking 4k
PTEs in the direct map not present can only be done if the direct map is
set up at 4k granularity in the first place (as ARM's break-before-make
semantics do not easily allow breaking apart large/gigantic pages).

More precisely, on arm64 systems with !can_set_direct_map(),
set_direct_map_invalid_noflush() is a no-op, however it returns success
(0) instead of an error.  This means that memfd_secret will seemingly
""work"" (e.g.  syscall succeeds, you can mmap the fd and fault in pages),
but it does not actually achieve its goal of removing its memory from the
direct map.

Note that with this patch, memfd_secret() will start erroring on systems
where can_set_direct_map() returns false (arm64 with
CONFIG_RODATA_FULL_DEFAULT_ENABLED=n, CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC=n and
CONFIG_KFENCE=n), but that still seems better than the current silent
failure.  Since CONFIG_RODATA_FULL_DEFAULT_ENABLED defaults to 'y', most
arm64 systems actually have a working memfd_secret() and aren't be
affected.

From going through the iterations of the original memfd_secret patch
series, it seems that disabling the syscall in these scenarios was the
intended behavior [1] (preferred over having
set_direct_map_invalid_noflush return an error as that would result in
SIGBUSes at page-fault time), however the check for it got dropped between
v16 [2] and v17 [3], when secretmem moved away from CMA allocations.

CVE-2024-41066,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ibmvnic: Add tx check to prevent skb leak

Below is a summary of how the driver stores a reference to an skb during
transmit:
    tx_buff[free_map[consumer_index]]->skb = new_skb;
    free_map[consumer_index] = IBMVNIC_INVALID_MAP;
    consumer_index ++;
Where variable data looks like this:
    free_map == [4, IBMVNIC_INVALID_MAP, IBMVNIC_INVALID_MAP, 0, 3]
                                               	consumer_index^
    tx_buff == [skb=null, skb=<ptr>, skb=<ptr>, skb=null, skb=null]

The driver has checks to ensure that free_map[consumer_index] pointed to
a valid index but there was no check to ensure that this index pointed
to an unused/null skb address. So, if, by some chance, our free_map and
tx_buff lists become out of sync then we were previously risking an
skb memory leak. This could then cause tcp congestion control to stop
sending packets, eventually leading to ETIMEDOUT.

Therefore, add a conditional to ensure that the skb address is null. If
not then warn the user (because this is still a bug that should be
patched) and free the old pointer to prevent memleak/tcp problems.",'-,5.5,6021689,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7288-1),4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,197473657,ptdtc-sv-bitb01.portugal.pt,"10.200.8.50,172.17.0.1","fe80:0:0:0:42:7aff:fe92:7344,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:6105,fe80:0:0:0:486:c5ff:fe04:9bda,fe80:0:0:0:2064:6aff:fee8:4cdd,fe80:0:0:0:4c35:f0ff:fe26:e83b,fe80:0:0:0:5c0e:f5ff:fe18:2a0c,fe80:0:0:0:9820:b0ff:fe61:59ca,fe80:0:0:0:b0d8:6cff:fed0:c3a4,fe80:0:0:0:b44a:2bff:fe3c:d229,fe80:0:0:0:d45e:3eff:fe97:5f28,fe80:0:0:0:ecdc:7ff:fed5:7f8f",Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7288-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7288-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,30,5,"Feb 25, 2025","Feb 24, 2025",Ubuntu,HIGH,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 22.04.4,'-,'-,28,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,237,,"#table cols=""3""

serial: protect uart_port_dtr_rts() in uart_shutdown() too

Commit af224ca2df29 (serial: core: Prevent unsafe uart port access, part

the commit assumes, uport can be NULL in there. But right after that
protection, there is an unprotected ""uart_port_dtr_rts(uport, false);""
call. That is invoked only if HUPCL is set, so I assume that is the
reason why we do not see lots of these reports.

that the register functions already did the needed checks.

CVE-2024-50194,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64: probes: Fix uprobes for big-endian kernels

The arm64 uprobes code is broken for big-endian kernels as it doesn't
convert the in-memory instruction encoding (which is always
little-endian) into the kernel's native endianness before analyzing and
simulating instructions. This may result in a few distinct problems:

* The kernel may may erroneously reject probing an instruction which can
  safely be probed.

* The kernel may erroneously erroneously permit stepping an
  instruction out-of-line when that instruction cannot be stepped
  out-of-line safely.

* The kernel may erroneously simulate instruction incorrectly dur to
  interpretting the byte-swapped encoding.

The endianness mismatch isn't caught by the compiler or sparse because:

* The arch_uprobe::{insn,ixol} fields are encoded as arrays of u8, so
  the compiler and sparse have no idea these contain a little-endian
  32-bit value. The core uprobes code populates these with a memcpy()
  which similarly does not handle endianness.

* While the uprobe_opcode_t type is an alias for __le32, both
  arch_uprobe_analyze_insn() and arch_uprobe_skip_sstep() cast from u8[]
  to the similarly-named probe_opcode_t, which is an alias for u32.
  Hence there is no endianness conversion warning.

Fix this by changing the arch_uprobe::{insn,ixol} fields to __le32 and
adding the appropriate __le32_to_cpu() conversions prior to consuming
the instruction encoding. The core uprobes copies these fields as opaque
ranges of bytes, and so is unaffected by this change.

At the same time, remove MAX_UINSN_BYTES and consistently use
AARCH64_INSN_SIZE for clarity.

CVE-2024-50229,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nilfs2: fix potential deadlock with newly created symlinks

Syzbot reported that page_symlink(), called by nilfs_symlink(), triggers
memory reclamation involving the filesystem layer, which can result in
circular lock dependencies among the reader/writer semaphore
nilfs->ns_segctor_sem, s_writers percpu_rwsem (intwrite) and the
fs_reclaim pseudo lock.

This is because after commit 21fc61c73c39 (""don't put symlink bodies in
pagecache into highmem""), the gfp flags of the page cache for symbolic
links are overwritten to GFP_KERNEL via inode_nohighmem().

This is not a problem for symlinks read from the backing device, because
the __GFP_FS flag is dropped after inode_nohighmem() is called.  However,
when a new symlink is created with nilfs_symlink(), the gfp flags remain
overwritten to GFP_KERNEL.  Then, memory allocation called from
page_symlink() etc.  triggers memory reclamation including the FS layer,
which may call nilfs_evict_inode() or nilfs_dirty_inode().  And these can
cause a deadlock if they are called while nilfs->ns_segctor_sem is held:

Fix this issue by dropping the __GFP_FS flag from the page cache GFP flags
of newly created symlinks in the same way that nilfs_new_inode() and
__nilfs_read_inode() do, as a workaround until we adopt nofs allocation
scope consistently or improve the locking constraints.",'-,5.5,6021689,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7288-1),4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,197473657,ptdtc-sv-bitb01.portugal.pt,"10.200.8.50,172.17.0.1","fe80:0:0:0:42:7aff:fe92:7344,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:6105,fe80:0:0:0:486:c5ff:fe04:9bda,fe80:0:0:0:2064:6aff:fee8:4cdd,fe80:0:0:0:4c35:f0ff:fe26:e83b,fe80:0:0:0:5c0e:f5ff:fe18:2a0c,fe80:0:0:0:9820:b0ff:fe61:59ca,fe80:0:0:0:b0d8:6cff:fed0:c3a4,fe80:0:0:0:b44a:2bff:fe3c:d229,fe80:0:0:0:d45e:3eff:fe97:5f28,fe80:0:0:0:ecdc:7ff:fed5:7f8f",Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7288-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7288-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,30,5,"Feb 25, 2025","Feb 24, 2025",Ubuntu,HIGH,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 22.04.4,'-,'-,28,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,237,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-53058,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: stmmac: TSO: Fix unbalanced DMA map/unmap for non-paged SKB data

In case the non-paged data of a SKB carries protocol header and protocol
payload to be transmitted on a certain platform that the DMA AXI address
width is configured to 40-bit/48-bit, or the size of the non-paged data
is bigger than TSO_MAX_BUFF_SIZE on a certain platform that the DMA AXI
address width is configured to 32-bit, then this SKB requires at least
two DMA transmit descriptors to serve it.

For example, three descriptors are allocated to split one DMA buffer
mapped from one piece of non-paged data:
    dma_desc[N + 0],
    dma_desc[N + 1],
    dma_desc[N + 2].
Then three elements of tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[] will be allocated to hold
extra information to be reused in stmmac_tx_clean():
    tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[N + 0],
    tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[N + 1],
    tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[N + 2].
Now we focus on tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[entry].buf, which is the DMA buffer
address returned by DMA mapping call. stmmac_tx_clean() will try to
unmap the DMA buffer _ONLY_IF_ tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[entry].buf
is a valid buffer address.

The expected behavior that saves DMA buffer address of this non-paged
data to tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[entry].buf is:
    tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[N + 0].buf = NULL;
    tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[N + 1].buf = NULL;
    tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[N + 2].buf = dma_map_single();
Unfortunately, the current code misbehaves like this:
    tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[N + 0].buf = dma_map_single();
    tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[N + 1].buf = NULL;
    tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[N + 2].buf = NULL;

On the stmmac_tx_clean() side, when dma_desc[N + 0] is closed by the
DMA engine, tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[N + 0].buf is a valid buffer address
obviously, then the DMA buffer will be unmapped immediately.
There may be a rare case that the DMA engine does not finish the
pending dma_desc[N + 1], dma_desc[N + 2] yet. Now things will go
horribly wrong, DMA is going to access a unmapped/unreferenced memory
region, corrupted data will be transmited or iommu fault will be
triggered :(

In contrast, the for-loop that maps SKB fragments behaves perfectly
as expected, and that is how the driver should do for both non-paged
data and paged frags actually.

This patch corrects DMA map/unmap sequences by fixing the array index
for tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[entry].buf when assigning DMA buffer address.

a noop. The code then goes on to dereference `dump_addr`.

Make the function print ""Registers not stored"" when it sees a NULL to
solve this. Since we're touching the code, fix
msm_disp_state_print_regs() not to pointlessly take a double-pointer
and properly mark the pointer as `const`.

CVE-2024-50278,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dm cache: fix potential out-of-bounds access on the first resume

Out-of-bounds access occurs if the fast device is expanded unexpectedly
before the first-time resume of the cache table. This happens because
expanding the fast device requires reloading the cache table for
cache_create to allocate new in-core data structures that fit the new
size, and the check in cache_preresume is not performed during the
first resume, leading to the issue.

Reproduce steps:

1. prepare component devices:

dmsetup create cmeta --table ""0 8192 linear /dev/sdc 0""
dmsetup create cdata --table ""0 65536 linear /dev/sdc 8192""
dmsetup create corig --table ""0 524288 linear /dev/sdc 262144""
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/mapper/cmeta bs=4k count=1 oflag=direct

2. load a cache table of 512 cache blocks, and deliberately expand the
   fast device before resuming the cache, making the in-core data
   structures inadequate.

dmsetup create cache --notable
dmsetup reload cache --table ""0 524288 cache /dev/mapper/cmeta \
/dev/mapper/cdata /dev/mapper/corig 128 2 metadata2 writethrough smq 0""
dmsetup reload cdata --table ""0 131072 linear /dev/sdc 8192""
dmsetup resume cdata
dmsetup resume cache

3. suspend the cache to write out the in-core dirty bitset and hint
   array, leading to out-of-bounds access to the dirty bitset at offset
   0x40:

dmsetup suspend cache

CVE-2024-50036,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: do not delay dst_entries_add() in dst_release()

dst_entries_add() uses per-cpu data that might be freed at netns
dismantle from ip6_route_net_exit() calling dst_entries_destroy()

Before ip6_route_net_exit() can be called, we release all
the dsts associated with this netns, via calls to dst_release(),
which waits an rcu grace period before calling dst_destroy()

dst_entries_add() use in dst_destroy() is racy, because
dst_entries_destroy() could have been called already.

Decrementing the number of dsts must happen sooner.

Notes:

1) in CONFIG_XFRM case, dst_destroy() can call
   dst_release_immediate(child), this might also cause UAF
   if the child does not have DST_NOCOUNT set.
   IPSEC maintainers might take a look and see how to address this.

CVE-2024-50273,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: reinitialize delayed ref list after deleting it from the list

At insert_delayed_ref() if we need to update the action of an existing
ref to BTRFS_DROP_DELAYED_REF, we delete the ref from its ref head's
ref_add_list using list_del(), which leaves the ref's add_list member
not reinitialized, as list_del() sets the next and prev members of the
list to LIST_POISON1 and LIST_POISON2, respectively.

If later we end up calling drop_delayed_ref() against the ref, which can
happen during merging or when destroying delayed refs due to a transaction
abort, we can trigger a crash since at drop_delayed_ref() we call
list_empty() against the ref's add_list, which returns false since
the list was not reinitialized after the list_del() and as a consequence
we call list_del() again at drop_delayed_ref(). This results in an
invalid list access since the next and prev members are set to poison
pointers, resulting in a splat if CONFIG_LIST_HARDENED and
CONFIG_DEBUG_LIST are set or invalid poison pointer dereferences
otherwise.

drm/shmem-helper: Fix BUG_ON() on mmap(PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE)

Lack of check for copy-on-write (COW) mapping in drm_gem_shmem_mmap

CVE-2024-50154,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tcp/dccp: Don't use timer_pending() in reqsk_queue_unlink().

Martin KaFai Lau reported use-after-free [0] in reqsk_timer_handler().

  """"""
  We are seeing a use-after-free from a bpf prog attached to
  trace_tcp_retransmit_synack. The program passes the req->sk to the
  bpf_sk_storage_get_tracing kernel helper which does check for null
  before using it.
  """"""

The commit 83fccfc3940c (""inet: fix potential deadlock in
reqsk_queue_unlink()"") added timer_pending() in reqsk_queue_unlink() not
to call del_timer_sync() from reqsk_timer_handler(), but it introduced a
small race window.

Before the timer is called, expire_timers() calls detach_timer(timer, true)
to clear timer->entry.pprev and marks it as not pending.

If reqsk_queue_unlink() checks timer_pending() just after expire_timers()
calls detach_timer(), TCP will miss del_timer_sync(); the reqsk timer will
continue running and send multiple SYN+ACKs until it expires.

The reported UAF could happen if req->sk is close()d earlier than the timer
expiration, which is 63s by default.

The scenario would be

  1. inet_csk_complete_hashdance() calls inet_csk_reqsk_queue_drop(),
     but del_timer_sync() is missed

  2. reqsk timer is executed and scheduled again

  3. req->sk is accept()ed and reqsk_put() decrements rsk_refcnt, but
     reqsk timer still has another one, and inet_csk_accept() does not
     clear req->sk for non-TFO sockets

  4. sk is close()d

  5. reqsk timer is executed again, and BPF touches req->sk

Let's not use timer_pending() by passing the caller context to
__inet_csk_reqsk_queue_drop().

Note that reqsk timer is pinned, so the issue does not happen in most
use cases. [1]

CVE-2024-50202,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nilfs2: propagate directory read errors from nilfs_find_entry()

Syzbot reported that a task hang occurs in vcs_open() during a fuzzing
test for nilfs2.

The root cause of this problem is that in nilfs_find_entry(), which
searches for directory entries, ignores errors when loading a directory
page/folio via nilfs_get_folio() fails.

If the filesystem images is corrupted, and the i_size of the directory
inode is large, and the directory page/folio is successfully read but
fails the sanity check, for example when it is zero-filled,
nilfs_check_folio() may continue to spit out error messages in bursts.

Fix this issue by propagating the error to the callers when loading a
page/folio fails in nilfs_find_entry().

The current interface of nilfs_find_entry() and its callers is outdated
and cannot propagate error codes such as -EIO and -ENOMEM returned via
nilfs_find_entry(), so fix it together.",'-,5.5,6021689,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7288-1),4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,197473657,ptdtc-sv-bitb01.portugal.pt,"10.200.8.50,172.17.0.1","fe80:0:0:0:42:7aff:fe92:7344,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:6105,fe80:0:0:0:486:c5ff:fe04:9bda,fe80:0:0:0:2064:6aff:fee8:4cdd,fe80:0:0:0:4c35:f0ff:fe26:e83b,fe80:0:0:0:5c0e:f5ff:fe18:2a0c,fe80:0:0:0:9820:b0ff:fe61:59ca,fe80:0:0:0:b0d8:6cff:fed0:c3a4,fe80:0:0:0:b44a:2bff:fe3c:d229,fe80:0:0:0:d45e:3eff:fe97:5f28,fe80:0:0:0:ecdc:7ff:fed5:7f8f",Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7288-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7288-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,30,5,"Feb 25, 2025","Feb 24, 2025",Ubuntu,HIGH,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 22.04.4,'-,'-,28,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,237,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-50162,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: devmap: provide rxq after redirect

rxq contains a pointer to the device from where
the redirect happened. Currently, the BPF program
that was executed after a redirect via BPF_MAP_TYPE_DEVMAP*
does not have it set.

This is particularly bad since accessing ingress_ifindex, e.g.

SEC(""xdp"")
int prog(struct xdp_md *pkt)
{
        return bpf_redirect_map(&dev_redirect_map, 0, 0);
}

SEC(""xdp/devmap"")
int prog_after_redirect(struct xdp_md *pkt)
{
        bpf_printk(""ifindex %i"", pkt->ingress_ifindex);
        return XDP_PASS;
}

depends on access to rxq, so a NULL pointer gets dereferenced:

drm/i915: Fix potential context UAFs

gem_context_register() makes the context visible to userspace, and which
point a separate thread can trigger the I915_GEM_CONTEXT_DESTROY ioctl.
So we need to ensure that nothing uses the ctx ptr after this.  And we
need to ensure that adding the ctx to the xarray is the *last* thing
that gem_context_register() does with the ctx pointer.

CVE-2024-50163,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Make sure internal and UAPI bpf_redirect flags don't overlap

The bpf_redirect_info is shared between the SKB and XDP redirect paths,
and the two paths use the same numeric flag values in the ri->flags
field (specifically, BPF_F_BROADCAST == BPF_F_NEXTHOP). This means that
if skb bpf_redirect_neigh() is used with a non-NULL params argument and,
subsequently, an XDP redirect is performed using the same
bpf_redirect_info struct, the XDP path will get confused and end up
crashing, which syzbot managed to trigger.

With the stack-allocated bpf_redirect_info, the structure is no longer
shared between the SKB and XDP paths, so the crash doesn't happen
anymore. However, different code paths using identically-numbered flag
values in the same struct field still seems like a bit of a mess, so
this patch cleans that up by moving the flag definitions together and
redefining the three flags in BPF_F_REDIRECT_INTERNAL to not overlap
with the flags used for XDP. It also adds a BUILD_BUG_ON() check to make
sure the overlap is not re-introduced by mistake.",'-,5.5,6021689,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7288-1),4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,197473657,ptdtc-sv-bitb01.portugal.pt,"10.200.8.50,172.17.0.1","fe80:0:0:0:42:7aff:fe92:7344,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:6105,fe80:0:0:0:486:c5ff:fe04:9bda,fe80:0:0:0:2064:6aff:fee8:4cdd,fe80:0:0:0:4c35:f0ff:fe26:e83b,fe80:0:0:0:5c0e:f5ff:fe18:2a0c,fe80:0:0:0:9820:b0ff:fe61:59ca,fe80:0:0:0:b0d8:6cff:fed0:c3a4,fe80:0:0:0:b44a:2bff:fe3c:d229,fe80:0:0:0:d45e:3eff:fe97:5f28,fe80:0:0:0:ecdc:7ff:fed5:7f8f",Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7288-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7288-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,'-,5,"Feb 25, 2025","Feb 24, 2025",Ubuntu,HIGH,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 22.04.4,'-,'-,28,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,237,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-53097,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm: krealloc: Fix MTE false alarm in __do_krealloc

This patch addresses an issue introduced by commit 1a83a716ec233 (""mm:
krealloc: consider spare memory for __GFP_ZERO"") which causes MTE
(Memory Tagging Extension) to falsely report a slab-out-of-bounds error.

The problem occurs when zeroing out spare memory in __do_krealloc. The
original code only considered software-based KASAN and did not account
for MTE. It does not reset the KASAN tag before calling memset, leading
to a mismatch between the pointer tag and the memory tag, resulting
in a false positive.

CVE-2024-53088,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

i40e: fix race condition by adding filter's intermediate sync state

Fix a race condition in the i40e driver that leads to MAC/VLAN filters
becoming corrupted and leaking. Address the issue that occurs under
heavy load when multiple threads are concurrently modifying MAC/VLAN
filters by setting mac and port VLAN.

1. Thread T0 allocates a filter in i40e_add_filter() within
        i40e_ndo_set_vf_port_vlan().
2. Thread T1 concurrently frees the filter in __i40e_del_filter() within
        i40e_ndo_set_vf_mac().
3. Subsequently, i40e_service_task() calls i40e_sync_vsi_filters(), which
        refers to the already freed filter memory, causing corruption.

Reproduction steps:
1. Spawn multiple VFs.
2. Apply a concurrent heavy load by running parallel operations to change
        MAC addresses on the VFs and change port VLANs on the host.
3. Observe errors in dmesg:
""Error I40E_AQ_RC_ENOSPC adding RX filters on VF XX,
	please set promiscuous on manually for VF XX"".

Exact code for stable reproduction Intel can't open-source now.

The fix involves implementing a new intermediate filter state,

CVE-2024-50010,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

exec: don't WARN for racy path_noexec check

Both i_mode and noexec checks wrapped in WARN_ON stem from an artifact
of the previous implementation. They used to legitimately check for the
condition, but that got moved up in two commits:
633fb6ac3980 (""exec: move S_ISREG() check earlier"")
0fd338b2d2cd (""exec: move path_noexec() check earlier"")

Instead of being removed said checks are WARN_ON'ed instead, which
has some debug value.

However, the spurious path_noexec check is racy, resulting in
unwarranted warnings should someone race with setting the noexec flag.

One can note there is more to perm-checking whether execve is allowed
and none of the conditions are guaranteed to still hold after they were
tested for.

Additionally this does not validate whether the code path did any perm
checking to begin with -- it will pass if the inode happens to be
regular.

Keep the redundant path_noexec() check even though it's mindless
nonsense checking for guarantee that isn't given so drop the WARN.

Reword the commentary and do small tidy ups while here.

CVE-2024-50099,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64: probes: Remove broken LDR (literal) uprobe support

The simulate_ldr_literal() and simulate_ldrsw_literal() functions are
unsafe to use for uprobes. Both functions were originally written for
use with kprobes, and access memory with plain C accesses. When uprobes
was added, these were reused unmodified even though they cannot safely
access user memory.

There are three key problems:

1) The plain C accesses do not have corresponding extable entries, and
   thus if they encounter a fault the kernel will treat these as
   unintentional accesses to user memory, resulting in a BUG() which
   will kill the kernel thread, and likely lead to further issues (e.g.
   lockup or panic()).

2) The plain C accesses are subject to HW PAN and SW PAN, and so when
   either is in use, any attempt to simulate an access to user memory
   will fault. Thus neither simulate_ldr_literal() nor
   simulate_ldrsw_literal() can do anything useful when simulating a
   user instruction on any system with HW PAN or SW PAN.

3) The plain C accesses are privileged, as they run in kernel context,
   and in practice can access a small range of kernel virtual addresses.
   The instructions they simulate have a range of +/-1MiB, and since the
   simulated instructions must itself be a user instructions in the
   TTBR0 address range, these can address the final 1MiB of the TTBR1
   acddress range by wrapping downwards from an address in the first
   1MiB of the TTBR0 address range.

   In contemporary kernels the last 8MiB of TTBR1 address range is
   reserved, and accesses to this will always fault, meaning this is no
   worse than (1).

   Historically, it was theoretically possible for the linear map or
   vmemmap to spill into the final 8MiB of the TTBR1 address range, but
   in practice this is extremely unlikely to occur as this would
   require either:

   * Having enough physical memory to fill the entire linear map all the
     way to the final 1MiB of the TTBR1 address range.

   * Getting unlucky with KASLR randomization of the linear map such
     that the populated region happens to overlap with the last 1MiB of
     the TTBR address range.

   ... and in either case if we were to spill into the final page there
   would be larger problems as the final page would alias with error
   pointers.

Practically speaking, (1) and (2) are the big issues. Given there have
been no reports of problems since the broken code was introduced, it
appears that no-one is relying on probing these instructions with
uprobes.

Avoid these issues by not allowing uprobes on LDR (literal) and LDRSW
(literal), limiting the use of simulate_ldr_literal() and
simulate_ldrsw_literal() to kprobes. Attempts to place uprobes on LDR
(literal) and LDRSW (literal) will be rejected as
arm_probe_decode_insn() will return INSN_REJECTED. In future we can
consider introducing working uprobes support for these instructions, but
this will require more significant work.",'-,5.5,6021689,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7288-1),4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,197473657,ptdtc-sv-bitb01.portugal.pt,"10.200.8.50,172.17.0.1","fe80:0:0:0:42:7aff:fe92:7344,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:6105,fe80:0:0:0:486:c5ff:fe04:9bda,fe80:0:0:0:2064:6aff:fee8:4cdd,fe80:0:0:0:4c35:f0ff:fe26:e83b,fe80:0:0:0:5c0e:f5ff:fe18:2a0c,fe80:0:0:0:9820:b0ff:fe61:59ca,fe80:0:0:0:b0d8:6cff:fed0:c3a4,fe80:0:0:0:b44a:2bff:fe3c:d229,fe80:0:0:0:d45e:3eff:fe97:5f28,fe80:0:0:0:ecdc:7ff:fed5:7f8f",Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7288-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7288-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,30,5,"Feb 25, 2025","Feb 24, 2025",Ubuntu,HIGH,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 22.04.4,'-,'-,28,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,237,,"#table cols=""3""

This issue was also reported by syzbot.

It can be reproduced by following these steps(more details [1]):
1. Obtain more than 32 inputs that have similar hashes, which ends with the
   pattern '0xxxxxxxe6'.
2. Reboot and add the keys obtained in step 1.

The reproducer demonstrates how this issue happened:
1. In the search_nested_keyrings function, when it iterates through the
   slots in a node(below tag ascend_to_node), if the slot pointer is meta
   and node->back_pointer != NULL(it means a root), it will proceed to
   descend_to_node. However, there is an exception. If node is the root,
   and one of the slots points to a shortcut, it will be treated as a
   keyring.
2. Whether the ptr is keyring decided by keyring_ptr_is_keyring function.
   However, KEYRING_PTR_SUBTYPE is 0x2UL, the same as
   ASSOC_ARRAY_PTR_SUBTYPE_MASK.
3. When 32 keys with the similar hashes are added to the tree, the ROOT
   has keys with hashes that are not similar (e.g. slot 0) and it splits
   NODE A without using a shortcut. When NODE A is filled with keys that
   all hashes are xxe6, the keys are similar, NODE A will split with a
   shortcut. Finally, it forms the tree as shown below, where slot 6 points
   to a shortcut.

                      NODE A
              +------>+---+
      ROOT    |       | 0 | xxe6
      +---+   |       +---+
 xxxx | 0 | shortcut  :   : xxe6
      +---+   |       +---+

4. As mentioned above, If a slot(slot 6) of the root points to a shortcut,
   it may be mistakenly transferred to a key*, leading to a read
   out-of-bounds read.

To fix this issue, one should jump to descend_to_node if the ptr is a
shortcut, regardless of whether the node is root or not.

CVE-2024-50141,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ACPI: PRM: Find EFI_MEMORY_RUNTIME block for PRM handler and context

PRMT needs to find the correct type of block to translate the PA-VA
mapping for EFI runtime services.

The issue arises because the PRMT is finding a block of type
EFI_CONVENTIONAL_MEMORY, which is not appropriate for runtime services
as described in Section 2.2.2 (Runtime Services) of the UEFI
Specification [1]. Since the PRM handler is a type of runtime service,
this causes an exception when the PRM handler is called.

    [Firmware Bug]: Unable to handle paging request in EFI runtime service
    WARNING: CPU: 22 PID: 4330 at drivers/firmware/efi/runtime-wrappers.c:341
        __efi_queue_work+0x11c/0x170
    Call trace:

Let PRMT find a block with EFI_MEMORY_RUNTIME for PRM handler and PRM
context.

If no suitable block is found, a warning message will be printed, but
the procedure continues to manage the next PRM handler.

However, if the PRM handler is actually called without proper allocation,
it would result in a failure during error handling.

By using the correct memory types for runtime services, ensure that the
PRM handler and the context are properly mapped in the virtual address
space during runtime, preventing the paging request error.

The issue is really that only memory that has been remapped for runtime
by the firmware can be used by the PRM handler, and so the region needs
to have the EFI_MEMORY_RUNTIME attribute.

So rq_qos_wake_function() calls wake_up_process(data->task), which calls
try_to_wake_up(), which faults in raw_spin_lock_irqsave(&p->pi_lock).

p comes from data->task, and data comes from the waitqueue entry, which
is stored on the waiter's stack in rq_qos_wait(). Analyzing the core
dump with drgn, I found that the waiter had already woken up and moved
on to a completely unrelated code path, clobbering what was previously
data->task. Meanwhile, the waker was passing the clobbered garbage in
data->task to wake_up_process(), leading to the crash.

What's happening is that in between rq_qos_wake_function() deleting the
waitqueue entry and calling wake_up_process(), rq_qos_wait() is finding
that it already got a token and returning. The race looks like this:

rq_qos_wait()                           rq_qos_wake_function()
==============================================================
prepare_to_wait_exclusive()
                                        data->got_token = true;
                                        list_del_init(&curr->entry);
if (data.got_token)
        break;
finish_wait(&rqw->wait, &data.wq);
  ^- returns immediately because
     list_empty_careful(&wq_entry->entry)
     is true
... return, go do something else ...
                                        wake_up_process(data->task)
                                          (NO LONGER VALID!)-^

Normally, finish_wait() is supposed to synchronize against the waker.
But, as noted above, it is returning immediately because the waitqueue
entry has already been removed from the waitqueue.

The bug is that rq_qos_wake_function() is accessing the waitqueue entry
AFTER deleting it. Note that autoremove_wake_function() wakes the waiter
and THEN deletes the waitqueue entry, which is the proper order.

Fix it by swapping the order. We also need to use
list_del_init_careful() to match the list_empty_careful() in
finish_wait().",'-,4.7,6021689,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7288-1),4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,197473657,ptdtc-sv-bitb01.portugal.pt,"10.200.8.50,172.17.0.1","fe80:0:0:0:42:7aff:fe92:7344,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:6105,fe80:0:0:0:486:c5ff:fe04:9bda,fe80:0:0:0:2064:6aff:fee8:4cdd,fe80:0:0:0:4c35:f0ff:fe26:e83b,fe80:0:0:0:5c0e:f5ff:fe18:2a0c,fe80:0:0:0:9820:b0ff:fe61:59ca,fe80:0:0:0:b0d8:6cff:fed0:c3a4,fe80:0:0:0:b44a:2bff:fe3c:d229,fe80:0:0:0:d45e:3eff:fe97:5f28,fe80:0:0:0:ecdc:7ff:fed5:7f8f",Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7288-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7288-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,30,5,"Feb 25, 2025","Feb 24, 2025",Ubuntu,HIGH,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 22.04.4,'-,'-,28,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,237,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-40953,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: Fix a data race on last_boosted_vcpu in kvm_vcpu_on_spin()

Use {READ,WRITE}_ONCE() to access kvm->last_boosted_vcpu to ensure the
loads and stores are atomic.  In the extremely unlikely scenario the
compiler tears the stores, it's theoretically possible for KVM to attempt
to get a vCPU using an out-of-bounds index, e.g. if the write is split
into multiple 8-bit stores, and is paired with a 32-bit load on a VM with
257 vCPUs:

  CPU0                              CPU1
  last_boosted_vcpu = 0xff;

                                    (last_boosted_vcpu = 0x100)
                                    last_boosted_vcpu[15:8] = 0x01;
  i = (last_boosted_vcpu = 0x1ff)
                                    last_boosted_vcpu[7:0] = 0x00;

  vcpu = kvm->vcpu_array[0x1ff];

CVE-2024-50115,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: nSVM: Ignore nCR3[4:0] when loading PDPTEs from memory

Ignore nCR3[4:0] when loading PDPTEs from memory for nested SVM, as bits
4:0 of CR3 are ignored when PAE paging is used, and thus VMRUN doesn't
enforce 32-byte alignment of nCR3.

In the absolute worst case scenario, failure to ignore bits 4:0 can result
in an out-of-bounds read, e.g. if the target page is at the end of a
memslot, and the VMM isn't using guard pages.

Per the APM:

  The CR3 register points to the base address of the page-directory-pointer
  table. The page-directory-pointer table is aligned on a 32-byte boundary,
  with the low 5 address bits 4:0 assumed to be 0.

And the SDM's much more explicit:

  4:0    Ignored

Note, KVM gets this right when loading PDPTRs, it's only the nSVM flow
that is broken.",'-,7.1,6021689,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7288-1),4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,197473657,ptdtc-sv-bitb01.portugal.pt,"10.200.8.50,172.17.0.1","fe80:0:0:0:42:7aff:fe92:7344,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:6105,fe80:0:0:0:486:c5ff:fe04:9bda,fe80:0:0:0:2064:6aff:fee8:4cdd,fe80:0:0:0:4c35:f0ff:fe26:e83b,fe80:0:0:0:5c0e:f5ff:fe18:2a0c,fe80:0:0:0:9820:b0ff:fe61:59ca,fe80:0:0:0:b0d8:6cff:fed0:c3a4,fe80:0:0:0:b44a:2bff:fe3c:d229,fe80:0:0:0:d45e:3eff:fe97:5f28,fe80:0:0:0:ecdc:7ff:fed5:7f8f",Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7288-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7288-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,35,5,"Feb 25, 2025","Feb 24, 2025",Ubuntu,HIGH,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 22.04.4,'-,'-,28,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,237,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-50116,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nilfs2: fix kernel bug due to missing clearing of buffer delay flag

Syzbot reported that after nilfs2 reads a corrupted file system image
and degrades to read-only, the BUG_ON check for the buffer delay flag
in submit_bh_wbc() may fail, causing a kernel bug.

This is because the buffer delay flag is not cleared when clearing the
buffer state flags to discard a page/folio or a buffer head. So, fix
this.

CVE-2024-50234,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: iwlegacy: Clear stale interrupts before resuming device

iwl4965 fails upon resume from hibernation on my laptop. The reason
seems to be a stale interrupt which isn't being cleared out before
interrupts are enabled. We end up with a race beween the resume
trying to bring things back up, and the restart work (queued form
the interrupt handler) trying to bring things down. Eventually
the whole thing blows up.

Fix the problem by clearing out any stale interrupts before
interrupts get enabled during resume.

CVE-2024-50074,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

parport: Proper fix for array out-of-bounds access

The recent fix for array out-of-bounds accesses replaced sprintf()
calls blindly with snprintf().  However, since snprintf() returns the
would-be-printed size, not the actually output size, the length
calculation can still go over the given limit.

CVE-2024-50195,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

posix-clock: Fix missing timespec64 check in pc_clock_settime()

As Andrew pointed out, it will make sense that the PTP core
checked timespec64 struct's tv_sec and tv_nsec range before calling
ptp->info->settime64().

As the man manual of clock_settime() said, if tp.tv_sec is negative or
tp.tv_nsec is outside the range [0..999,999,999], it should return EINVAL,
which include dynamic clocks which handles PTP clock, and the condition is
consistent with timespec64_valid(). As Thomas suggested, timespec64_valid()
only check the timespec is valid, but not ensure that the time is
in a valid range, so check it ahead using timespec64_valid_strict()
in pc_clock_settime() and return -EINVAL if not valid.

There are some drivers that use tp->tv_sec and tp->tv_nsec directly to
write registers without validity checks and assume that the higher layer
has checked it, which is dangerous and will benefit from this, such as
hclge_ptp_settime(), igb_ptp_settime_i210(), _rcar_gen4_ptp_settime(),
and some drivers can remove the checks of itself.",'-,5.5,6021689,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7288-1),4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,197473657,ptdtc-sv-bitb01.portugal.pt,"10.200.8.50,172.17.0.1","fe80:0:0:0:42:7aff:fe92:7344,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:6105,fe80:0:0:0:486:c5ff:fe04:9bda,fe80:0:0:0:2064:6aff:fee8:4cdd,fe80:0:0:0:4c35:f0ff:fe26:e83b,fe80:0:0:0:5c0e:f5ff:fe18:2a0c,fe80:0:0:0:9820:b0ff:fe61:59ca,fe80:0:0:0:b0d8:6cff:fed0:c3a4,fe80:0:0:0:b44a:2bff:fe3c:d229,fe80:0:0:0:d45e:3eff:fe97:5f28,fe80:0:0:0:ecdc:7ff:fed5:7f8f",Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7288-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7288-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,30,5,"Feb 25, 2025","Feb 24, 2025",Ubuntu,HIGH,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 22.04.4,'-,'-,28,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,237,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-50196,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

pinctrl: ocelot: fix system hang on level based interrupts

The current implementation only calls chained_irq_enter() and
chained_irq_exit() if it detects pending interrupts.

```
for (i = 0; i < info->stride; i++) {
	uregmap_read(info->map, id_reg + 4 * i, &reg);
	if (!reg)
		continue;

	chained_irq_enter(parent_chip, desc);
```

However, in case of GPIO pin configured in level mode and the parent
controller configured in edge mode, GPIO interrupt might be lowered by the
hardware. In the result, if the interrupt is short enough, the parent
interrupt is still pending while the GPIO interrupt is cleared;
chained_irq_enter() never gets called and the system hangs trying to
service the parent interrupt.

Moving chained_irq_enter() and chained_irq_exit() outside the for loop
ensures that they are called even when GPIO interrupt is lowered by the
hardware.

The similar code with chained_irq_enter() / chained_irq_exit() functions
wrapping interrupt checking loop may be found in many other drivers:

grep -r -A 10 chained_irq_enter drivers/pinctrl

CVE-2024-26718,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dm-crypt, dm-verity: disable tasklets

Tasklets have an inherent problem with memory corruption. The function
tasklet_action_common calls tasklet_trylock, then it calls the tasklet
callback and then it calls tasklet_unlock. If the tasklet callback frees
the structure that contains the tasklet or if it calls some code that may
free it, tasklet_unlock will write into free memory.

The commits 8e14f610159d and d9a02e016aaf try to fix it for dm-crypt, but
it is not a sufficient fix and the data corruption can still happen [1].
There is no fix for dm-verity and dm-verity will write into free memory
with every tasklet-processed bio.

There will be atomic workqueues implemented in the kernel 6.9 [2]. They
will have better interface and they will not suffer from the memory
corruption problem.

But we need something that stops the memory corruption now and that can be
backported to the stable kernels. So, I'm proposing this commit that
disables tasklets in both dm-crypt and dm-verity. This commit doesn't
remove the tasklet support, because the tasklet code will be reused when

CVE-2024-51744,"golang-jwt is a Go implementation of JSON Web Tokens. Unclear documentation of the error behavior in `ParseWithClaims` can lead to situation where users are potentially not checking errors in the way they should be. Especially, if a token is both expired and invalid, the errors returned by `ParseWithClaims` return both error codes. If users only check for the `jwt.ErrTokenExpired ` using `error.Is`, they will ignore the embedded `jwt.ErrTokenSignatureInvalid` and thus potentially accept invalid tokens. A fix has been back-ported with the error handling logic from the `v5` branch to the `v4` branch. In this logic, the `ParseWithClaims` function will immediately return in ""dangerous"" situations (e.g., an invalid signature), limiting the combined errors only to situations where the signature is valid, but further validation failed (e.g., if the signature is valid, but is expired AND has the wrong audience). This fix is part of the 4.5.1 release. We are aware that this changes the behaviour of an established function and is not 100 % backwards compatible, so updating to 4.5.1 might break your code. In case you cannot update to 4.5.0, please make sure that you are properly checking for all errors (""dangerous"" ones first), so that you are not running in the case detailed above.",'-,'-,358558,Amazon Linux Security Advisory for docker : ALAS2DOCKER-2025-051,2,2,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 26, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,197474717,ptaws-sv-uhpp1.portugal.pt,"10.64.192.143,172.17.0.1,172.19.0.1","fe80:0:0:0:42:3bff:fe53:bb5f,fe80:0:0:0:42:57ff:fe5c:ce86,fe80:0:0:0:808:bbff:fe3a:7853,fe80:0:0:0:4005:e1ff:fea2:518c,fe80:0:0:0:4442:edff:fe5d:2d43,fe80:0:0:0:80f3:36ff:fe32:8fb7,fe80:0:0:0:888d:e9ff:fe23:44f3,fe80:0:0:0:a877:7ff:fee5:742a,fe80:0:0:0:f0e1:ebff:fea9:186c","Please refer to Amazon advisory: ALAS2DOCKER-2025-051 for affected packages and patching details, or update with your package manager.(https://alas.aws.amazon.com/AL2/ALASDOCKER-2025-051.html)","PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,20,4,"Feb 26, 2025","Feb 12, 2025",Amazon Linux,LOW,High Lateral Movement,Amazon Linux 2,'-,'-,10,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a securitybreach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,238,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-51744,"golang-jwt is a Go implementation of JSON Web Tokens. Unclear documentation of the error behavior in `ParseWithClaims` can lead to situation where users are potentially not checking errors in the way they should be. Especially, if a token is both expired and invalid, the errors returned by `ParseWithClaims` return both error codes. If users only check for the `jwt.ErrTokenExpired ` using `error.Is`, they will ignore the embedded `jwt.ErrTokenSignatureInvalid` and thus potentially accept invalid tokens. A fix has been back-ported with the error handling logic from the `v5` branch to the `v4` branch. In this logic, the `ParseWithClaims` function will immediately return in ""dangerous"" situations (e.g., an invalid signature), limiting the combined errors only to situations where the signature is valid, but further validation failed (e.g., if the signature is valid, but is expired AND has the wrong audience). This fix is part of the 4.5.1 release. We are aware that this changes the behaviour of an established function and is not 100 % backwards compatible, so updating to 4.5.1 might break your code. In case you cannot update to 4.5.0, please make sure that you are properly checking for all errors (""dangerous"" ones first), so that you are not running in the case detailed above.",'-,'-,358562,Amazon Linux Security Advisory for docker : ALAS2NITRO-ENCLAVES-2025-050,2,2,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 26, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,197474717,ptaws-sv-uhpp1.portugal.pt,"10.64.192.143,172.17.0.1,172.19.0.1","fe80:0:0:0:42:3bff:fe53:bb5f,fe80:0:0:0:42:57ff:fe5c:ce86,fe80:0:0:0:808:bbff:fe3a:7853,fe80:0:0:0:4005:e1ff:fea2:518c,fe80:0:0:0:4442:edff:fe5d:2d43,fe80:0:0:0:80f3:36ff:fe32:8fb7,fe80:0:0:0:888d:e9ff:fe23:44f3,fe80:0:0:0:a877:7ff:fee5:742a,fe80:0:0:0:f0e1:ebff:fea9:186c","Please refer to Amazon advisory: ALAS2NITRO-ENCLAVES-2025-050 for affected packages and patching details, or update with your package manager.(https://alas.aws.amazon.com/AL2/ALASNITRO-ENCLAVES-2025-050.html)","PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,20,4,"Feb 26, 2025","Feb 12, 2025",Amazon Linux,LOW,High Lateral Movement,Amazon Linux 2,'-,'-,10,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a securitybreach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,238,,"#table cols=""3""

the private key exists in the ECDSA signature computation.

Impact summary: A timing side-channel in ECDSA signature computations
could allow recovering the private key by an attacker. However, measuring
the timing would require either local access to the signing application or
a very fast network connection with low latency.

There is a timing signal of around 300 nanoseconds when the top word of
the inverted ECDSA nonce value is zero. This can happen with significant
probability only for some of the supported elliptic curves. In particular
the NIST P-521 curve is affected. To be able to measure this leak, the attacker

have a very fast network connection with low latency. For that reason

CVE-2024-9143,"Issue summary: Use of the low-level GF(2^m) elliptic curve APIs with untrusted
explicit values for the field polynomial can lead to out-of-bounds memory reads
or writes.

Impact summary: Out of bound memory writes can lead to an application crash or
even a possibility of a remote code execution, however, in all the protocols
involving Elliptic Curve Cryptography that we're aware of, either only ""named
curves"" are supported, or, if explicit curve parameters are supported, they
specify an X9.62 encoding of binary (GF(2^m)) curves that can't represent
problematic input values. Thus the likelihood of existence of a vulnerable
application is low.

In particular, the X9.62 encoding is used for ECC keys in X.509 certificates,
so problematic inputs cannot occur in the context of processing X.509
certificates.  Any problematic use-cases would have to be using an ""exotic""
curve encoding.

The affected APIs include: EC_GROUP_new_curve_GF2m(), EC_GROUP_new_from_params(),
and various supporting BN_GF2m_*() functions.

Applications working with ""exotic"" explicit binary (GF(2^m)) curve parameters,
that make it possible to represent invalid field polynomials with a zero
constant term, via the above or similar APIs, may terminate abruptly as a
result of reading or writing outside of array bounds.  Remote code execution
cannot easily be ruled out.

CVE-2024-53052,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

io_uring/rw: fix missing NOWAIT check for O_DIRECT start write

When io_uring starts a write, it'll call kiocb_start_write() to bump the
super block rwsem, preventing any freezes from happening while that
write is in-flight. The freeze side will grab that rwsem for writing,
excluding any new writers from happening and waiting for existing writes
to finish. But io_uring unconditionally uses kiocb_start_write(), which
will block if someone is currently attempting to freeze the mount point.
This causes a deadlock where freeze is waiting for previous writes to
complete, but the previous writes cannot complete, as the task that is
supposed to complete them is blocked waiting on starting a new write.
This results in the following stuck trace showing that dependency with
the write blocked starting a new write:

where IOCB_NOWAIT would always be set, this returns -EAGAIN which will
have io_uring core issue a blocking attempt of the write. That will in

CVE-2024-50182,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

secretmem: disable memfd_secret() if arch cannot set direct map

Return -ENOSYS from memfd_secret() syscall if !can_set_direct_map().  This
is the case for example on some arm64 configurations, where marking 4k
PTEs in the direct map not present can only be done if the direct map is
set up at 4k granularity in the first place (as ARM's break-before-make
semantics do not easily allow breaking apart large/gigantic pages).

More precisely, on arm64 systems with !can_set_direct_map(),
set_direct_map_invalid_noflush() is a no-op, however it returns success
(0) instead of an error.  This means that memfd_secret will seemingly
""work"" (e.g.  syscall succeeds, you can mmap the fd and fault in pages),
but it does not actually achieve its goal of removing its memory from the
direct map.

Note that with this patch, memfd_secret() will start erroring on systems
where can_set_direct_map() returns false (arm64 with
CONFIG_RODATA_FULL_DEFAULT_ENABLED=n, CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC=n and
CONFIG_KFENCE=n), but that still seems better than the current silent
failure.  Since CONFIG_RODATA_FULL_DEFAULT_ENABLED defaults to 'y', most
arm64 systems actually have a working memfd_secret() and aren't be
affected.

From going through the iterations of the original memfd_secret patch
series, it seems that disabling the syscall in these scenarios was the
intended behavior [1] (preferred over having
set_direct_map_invalid_noflush return an error as that would result in
SIGBUSes at page-fault time), however the check for it got dropped between
v16 [2] and v17 [3], when secretmem moved away from CMA allocations.

CVE-2024-41066,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ibmvnic: Add tx check to prevent skb leak

Below is a summary of how the driver stores a reference to an skb during
transmit:
    tx_buff[free_map[consumer_index]]->skb = new_skb;
    free_map[consumer_index] = IBMVNIC_INVALID_MAP;
    consumer_index ++;
Where variable data looks like this:
    free_map == [4, IBMVNIC_INVALID_MAP, IBMVNIC_INVALID_MAP, 0, 3]
                                               	consumer_index^
    tx_buff == [skb=null, skb=<ptr>, skb=<ptr>, skb=null, skb=null]

The driver has checks to ensure that free_map[consumer_index] pointed to
a valid index but there was no check to ensure that this index pointed
to an unused/null skb address. So, if, by some chance, our free_map and
tx_buff lists become out of sync then we were previously risking an
skb memory leak. This could then cause tcp congestion control to stop
sending packets, eventually leading to ETIMEDOUT.

Therefore, add a conditional to ensure that the skb address is null. If
not then warn the user (because this is still a bug that should be
patched) and free the old pointer to prevent memleak/tcp problems.",'-,5.5,6021689,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7288-1),4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,264320811,ptdtc-sv-wzsrv2.portugal.pt,10.200.11.154,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:d3b7,Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7288-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7288-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,30,5,"Feb 25, 2025","Feb 24, 2025",Ubuntu,HIGH,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 22.04.5,'-,'-,26,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,236,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-50194,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64: probes: Fix uprobes for big-endian kernels

The arm64 uprobes code is broken for big-endian kernels as it doesn't
convert the in-memory instruction encoding (which is always
little-endian) into the kernel's native endianness before analyzing and
simulating instructions. This may result in a few distinct problems:

* The kernel may may erroneously reject probing an instruction which can
  safely be probed.

* The kernel may erroneously erroneously permit stepping an
  instruction out-of-line when that instruction cannot be stepped
  out-of-line safely.

* The kernel may erroneously simulate instruction incorrectly dur to
  interpretting the byte-swapped encoding.

The endianness mismatch isn't caught by the compiler or sparse because:

* The arch_uprobe::{insn,ixol} fields are encoded as arrays of u8, so
  the compiler and sparse have no idea these contain a little-endian
  32-bit value. The core uprobes code populates these with a memcpy()
  which similarly does not handle endianness.

* While the uprobe_opcode_t type is an alias for __le32, both
  arch_uprobe_analyze_insn() and arch_uprobe_skip_sstep() cast from u8[]
  to the similarly-named probe_opcode_t, which is an alias for u32.
  Hence there is no endianness conversion warning.

Fix this by changing the arch_uprobe::{insn,ixol} fields to __le32 and
adding the appropriate __le32_to_cpu() conversions prior to consuming
the instruction encoding. The core uprobes copies these fields as opaque
ranges of bytes, and so is unaffected by this change.

At the same time, remove MAX_UINSN_BYTES and consistently use
AARCH64_INSN_SIZE for clarity.

CVE-2024-50229,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nilfs2: fix potential deadlock with newly created symlinks

Syzbot reported that page_symlink(), called by nilfs_symlink(), triggers
memory reclamation involving the filesystem layer, which can result in
circular lock dependencies among the reader/writer semaphore
nilfs->ns_segctor_sem, s_writers percpu_rwsem (intwrite) and the
fs_reclaim pseudo lock.

This is because after commit 21fc61c73c39 (""don't put symlink bodies in
pagecache into highmem""), the gfp flags of the page cache for symbolic
links are overwritten to GFP_KERNEL via inode_nohighmem().

This is not a problem for symlinks read from the backing device, because
the __GFP_FS flag is dropped after inode_nohighmem() is called.  However,
when a new symlink is created with nilfs_symlink(), the gfp flags remain
overwritten to GFP_KERNEL.  Then, memory allocation called from
page_symlink() etc.  triggers memory reclamation including the FS layer,
which may call nilfs_evict_inode() or nilfs_dirty_inode().  And these can
cause a deadlock if they are called while nilfs->ns_segctor_sem is held:

Fix this issue by dropping the __GFP_FS flag from the page cache GFP flags
of newly created symlinks in the same way that nilfs_new_inode() and
__nilfs_read_inode() do, as a workaround until we adopt nofs allocation
scope consistently or improve the locking constraints.",'-,5.5,6021689,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7288-1),4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,264320811,ptdtc-sv-wzsrv2.portugal.pt,10.200.11.154,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:d3b7,Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7288-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7288-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,30,5,"Feb 25, 2025","Feb 24, 2025",Ubuntu,HIGH,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 22.04.5,'-,'-,26,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,236,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-53058,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: stmmac: TSO: Fix unbalanced DMA map/unmap for non-paged SKB data

In case the non-paged data of a SKB carries protocol header and protocol
payload to be transmitted on a certain platform that the DMA AXI address
width is configured to 40-bit/48-bit, or the size of the non-paged data
is bigger than TSO_MAX_BUFF_SIZE on a certain platform that the DMA AXI
address width is configured to 32-bit, then this SKB requires at least
two DMA transmit descriptors to serve it.

For example, three descriptors are allocated to split one DMA buffer
mapped from one piece of non-paged data:
    dma_desc[N + 0],
    dma_desc[N + 1],
    dma_desc[N + 2].
Then three elements of tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[] will be allocated to hold
extra information to be reused in stmmac_tx_clean():
    tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[N + 0],
    tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[N + 1],
    tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[N + 2].
Now we focus on tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[entry].buf, which is the DMA buffer
address returned by DMA mapping call. stmmac_tx_clean() will try to
unmap the DMA buffer _ONLY_IF_ tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[entry].buf
is a valid buffer address.

The expected behavior that saves DMA buffer address of this non-paged
data to tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[entry].buf is:
    tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[N + 0].buf = NULL;
    tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[N + 1].buf = NULL;
    tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[N + 2].buf = dma_map_single();
Unfortunately, the current code misbehaves like this:
    tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[N + 0].buf = dma_map_single();
    tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[N + 1].buf = NULL;
    tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[N + 2].buf = NULL;

On the stmmac_tx_clean() side, when dma_desc[N + 0] is closed by the
DMA engine, tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[N + 0].buf is a valid buffer address
obviously, then the DMA buffer will be unmapped immediately.
There may be a rare case that the DMA engine does not finish the
pending dma_desc[N + 1], dma_desc[N + 2] yet. Now things will go
horribly wrong, DMA is going to access a unmapped/unreferenced memory
region, corrupted data will be transmited or iommu fault will be
triggered :(

In contrast, the for-loop that maps SKB fragments behaves perfectly
as expected, and that is how the driver should do for both non-paged
data and paged frags actually.

This patch corrects DMA map/unmap sequences by fixing the array index
for tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[entry].buf when assigning DMA buffer address.

dm cache: fix potential out-of-bounds access on the first resume

Out-of-bounds access occurs if the fast device is expanded unexpectedly
before the first-time resume of the cache table. This happens because
expanding the fast device requires reloading the cache table for
cache_create to allocate new in-core data structures that fit the new
size, and the check in cache_preresume is not performed during the
first resume, leading to the issue.

Reproduce steps:

1. prepare component devices:

dmsetup create cmeta --table ""0 8192 linear /dev/sdc 0""
dmsetup create cdata --table ""0 65536 linear /dev/sdc 8192""
dmsetup create corig --table ""0 524288 linear /dev/sdc 262144""
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/mapper/cmeta bs=4k count=1 oflag=direct

2. load a cache table of 512 cache blocks, and deliberately expand the
   fast device before resuming the cache, making the in-core data
   structures inadequate.

dmsetup create cache --notable
dmsetup reload cache --table ""0 524288 cache /dev/mapper/cmeta \
/dev/mapper/cdata /dev/mapper/corig 128 2 metadata2 writethrough smq 0""
dmsetup reload cdata --table ""0 131072 linear /dev/sdc 8192""
dmsetup resume cdata
dmsetup resume cache

3. suspend the cache to write out the in-core dirty bitset and hint
   array, leading to out-of-bounds access to the dirty bitset at offset
   0x40:

CVE-2024-50273,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: reinitialize delayed ref list after deleting it from the list

At insert_delayed_ref() if we need to update the action of an existing
ref to BTRFS_DROP_DELAYED_REF, we delete the ref from its ref head's
ref_add_list using list_del(), which leaves the ref's add_list member
not reinitialized, as list_del() sets the next and prev members of the
list to LIST_POISON1 and LIST_POISON2, respectively.

If later we end up calling drop_delayed_ref() against the ref, which can
happen during merging or when destroying delayed refs due to a transaction
abort, we can trigger a crash since at drop_delayed_ref() we call
list_empty() against the ref's add_list, which returns false since
the list was not reinitialized after the list_del() and as a consequence
we call list_del() again at drop_delayed_ref(). This results in an
invalid list access since the next and prev members are set to poison
pointers, resulting in a splat if CONFIG_LIST_HARDENED and
CONFIG_DEBUG_LIST are set or invalid poison pointer dereferences
otherwise.

So fix this by deleting from the list with list_del_init() instead.",'-,5.5,6021689,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7288-1),4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,264320811,ptdtc-sv-wzsrv2.portugal.pt,10.200.11.154,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:d3b7,Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7288-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7288-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,'-,5,"Feb 25, 2025","Feb 24, 2025",Ubuntu,HIGH,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 22.04.5,'-,'-,26,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,236,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-50154,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tcp/dccp: Don't use timer_pending() in reqsk_queue_unlink().

Martin KaFai Lau reported use-after-free [0] in reqsk_timer_handler().

  """"""
  We are seeing a use-after-free from a bpf prog attached to
  trace_tcp_retransmit_synack. The program passes the req->sk to the
  bpf_sk_storage_get_tracing kernel helper which does check for null
  before using it.
  """"""

The commit 83fccfc3940c (""inet: fix potential deadlock in
reqsk_queue_unlink()"") added timer_pending() in reqsk_queue_unlink() not
to call del_timer_sync() from reqsk_timer_handler(), but it introduced a
small race window.

Before the timer is called, expire_timers() calls detach_timer(timer, true)
to clear timer->entry.pprev and marks it as not pending.

If reqsk_queue_unlink() checks timer_pending() just after expire_timers()
calls detach_timer(), TCP will miss del_timer_sync(); the reqsk timer will
continue running and send multiple SYN+ACKs until it expires.

The reported UAF could happen if req->sk is close()d earlier than the timer
expiration, which is 63s by default.

The scenario would be

  1. inet_csk_complete_hashdance() calls inet_csk_reqsk_queue_drop(),
     but del_timer_sync() is missed

  2. reqsk timer is executed and scheduled again

  3. req->sk is accept()ed and reqsk_put() decrements rsk_refcnt, but
     reqsk timer still has another one, and inet_csk_accept() does not
     clear req->sk for non-TFO sockets

  4. sk is close()d

  5. reqsk timer is executed again, and BPF touches req->sk

Let's not use timer_pending() by passing the caller context to
__inet_csk_reqsk_queue_drop().

Note that reqsk timer is pinned, so the issue does not happen in most
use cases. [1]

nilfs2: propagate directory read errors from nilfs_find_entry()

Syzbot reported that a task hang occurs in vcs_open() during a fuzzing
test for nilfs2.

The root cause of this problem is that in nilfs_find_entry(), which
searches for directory entries, ignores errors when loading a directory
page/folio via nilfs_get_folio() fails.

If the filesystem images is corrupted, and the i_size of the directory
inode is large, and the directory page/folio is successfully read but
fails the sanity check, for example when it is zero-filled,
nilfs_check_folio() may continue to spit out error messages in bursts.

Fix this issue by propagating the error to the callers when loading a
page/folio fails in nilfs_find_entry().

The current interface of nilfs_find_entry() and its callers is outdated
and cannot propagate error codes such as -EIO and -ENOMEM returned via
nilfs_find_entry(), so fix it together.",'-,5.5,6021689,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7288-1),4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,264320811,ptdtc-sv-wzsrv2.portugal.pt,10.200.11.154,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:d3b7,Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7288-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7288-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,30,5,"Feb 25, 2025","Feb 24, 2025",Ubuntu,HIGH,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 22.04.5,'-,'-,26,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,236,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-50162,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: devmap: provide rxq after redirect

rxq contains a pointer to the device from where
the redirect happened. Currently, the BPF program
that was executed after a redirect via BPF_MAP_TYPE_DEVMAP*
does not have it set.

This is particularly bad since accessing ingress_ifindex, e.g.

SEC(""xdp"")
int prog(struct xdp_md *pkt)
{
        return bpf_redirect_map(&dev_redirect_map, 0, 0);
}

SEC(""xdp/devmap"")

{
        bpf_printk(""ifindex %i"", pkt->ingress_ifindex);
        return XDP_PASS;
}

depends on access to rxq, so a NULL pointer gets dereferenced:

CVE-2024-50163,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Make sure internal and UAPI bpf_redirect flags don't overlap

The bpf_redirect_info is shared between the SKB and XDP redirect paths,
and the two paths use the same numeric flag values in the ri->flags
field (specifically, BPF_F_BROADCAST == BPF_F_NEXTHOP). This means that
if skb bpf_redirect_neigh() is used with a non-NULL params argument and,
subsequently, an XDP redirect is performed using the same
bpf_redirect_info struct, the XDP path will get confused and end up
crashing, which syzbot managed to trigger.

With the stack-allocated bpf_redirect_info, the structure is no longer
shared between the SKB and XDP paths, so the crash doesn't happen
anymore. However, different code paths using identically-numbered flag
values in the same struct field still seems like a bit of a mess, so
this patch cleans that up by moving the flag definitions together and

CVE-2024-53097,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm: krealloc: Fix MTE false alarm in __do_krealloc

This patch addresses an issue introduced by commit 1a83a716ec233 (""mm:
krealloc: consider spare memory for __GFP_ZERO"") which causes MTE
(Memory Tagging Extension) to falsely report a slab-out-of-bounds error.

The problem occurs when zeroing out spare memory in __do_krealloc. The
original code only considered software-based KASAN and did not account
for MTE. It does not reset the KASAN tag before calling memset, leading
to a mismatch between the pointer tag and the memory tag, resulting
in a false positive.

CVE-2024-53088,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

i40e: fix race condition by adding filter's intermediate sync state

Fix a race condition in the i40e driver that leads to MAC/VLAN filters
becoming corrupted and leaking. Address the issue that occurs under
heavy load when multiple threads are concurrently modifying MAC/VLAN
filters by setting mac and port VLAN.

1. Thread T0 allocates a filter in i40e_add_filter() within
        i40e_ndo_set_vf_port_vlan().
2. Thread T1 concurrently frees the filter in __i40e_del_filter() within
        i40e_ndo_set_vf_mac().
3. Subsequently, i40e_service_task() calls i40e_sync_vsi_filters(), which
        refers to the already freed filter memory, causing corruption.

Reproduction steps:
1. Spawn multiple VFs.
2. Apply a concurrent heavy load by running parallel operations to change
        MAC addresses on the VFs and change port VLANs on the host.
3. Observe errors in dmesg:
""Error I40E_AQ_RC_ENOSPC adding RX filters on VF XX,
	please set promiscuous on manually for VF XX"".

Exact code for stable reproduction Intel can't open-source now.

The fix involves implementing a new intermediate filter state,
I40E_FILTER_NEW_SYNC, for the time when a filter is on a tmp_add_list.

CVE-2024-50010,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

exec: don't WARN for racy path_noexec check

Both i_mode and noexec checks wrapped in WARN_ON stem from an artifact
of the previous implementation. They used to legitimately check for the
condition, but that got moved up in two commits:
633fb6ac3980 (""exec: move S_ISREG() check earlier"")
0fd338b2d2cd (""exec: move path_noexec() check earlier"")

Instead of being removed said checks are WARN_ON'ed instead, which
has some debug value.

However, the spurious path_noexec check is racy, resulting in
unwarranted warnings should someone race with setting the noexec flag.

One can note there is more to perm-checking whether execve is allowed
and none of the conditions are guaranteed to still hold after they were
tested for.

Additionally this does not validate whether the code path did any perm
checking to begin with -- it will pass if the inode happens to be
regular.

Keep the redundant path_noexec() check even though it's mindless
nonsense checking for guarantee that isn't given so drop the WARN.

CVE-2024-50099,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64: probes: Remove broken LDR (literal) uprobe support

The simulate_ldr_literal() and simulate_ldrsw_literal() functions are
unsafe to use for uprobes. Both functions were originally written for
use with kprobes, and access memory with plain C accesses. When uprobes
was added, these were reused unmodified even though they cannot safely
access user memory.

There are three key problems:

1) The plain C accesses do not have corresponding extable entries, and
   thus if they encounter a fault the kernel will treat these as
   unintentional accesses to user memory, resulting in a BUG() which
   will kill the kernel thread, and likely lead to further issues (e.g.
   lockup or panic()).

2) The plain C accesses are subject to HW PAN and SW PAN, and so when
   either is in use, any attempt to simulate an access to user memory
   will fault. Thus neither simulate_ldr_literal() nor
   simulate_ldrsw_literal() can do anything useful when simulating a
   user instruction on any system with HW PAN or SW PAN.

3) The plain C accesses are privileged, as they run in kernel context,
   and in practice can access a small range of kernel virtual addresses.
   The instructions they simulate have a range of +/-1MiB, and since the
   simulated instructions must itself be a user instructions in the
   TTBR0 address range, these can address the final 1MiB of the TTBR1
   acddress range by wrapping downwards from an address in the first
   1MiB of the TTBR0 address range.

   In contemporary kernels the last 8MiB of TTBR1 address range is
   reserved, and accesses to this will always fault, meaning this is no
   worse than (1).

   Historically, it was theoretically possible for the linear map or
   vmemmap to spill into the final 8MiB of the TTBR1 address range, but
   in practice this is extremely unlikely to occur as this would
   require either:

   * Having enough physical memory to fill the entire linear map all the
     way to the final 1MiB of the TTBR1 address range.

   * Getting unlucky with KASLR randomization of the linear map such
     that the populated region happens to overlap with the last 1MiB of
     the TTBR address range.

   ... and in either case if we were to spill into the final page there
   would be larger problems as the final page would alias with error
   pointers.

Practically speaking, (1) and (2) are the big issues. Given there have
been no reports of problems since the broken code was introduced, it
appears that no-one is relying on probing these instructions with
uprobes.

Avoid these issues by not allowing uprobes on LDR (literal) and LDRSW
(literal), limiting the use of simulate_ldr_literal() and
simulate_ldrsw_literal() to kprobes. Attempts to place uprobes on LDR
(literal) and LDRSW (literal) will be rejected as
arm_probe_decode_insn() will return INSN_REJECTED. In future we can
consider introducing working uprobes support for these instructions, but
this will require more significant work.",'-,5.5,6021689,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7288-1),4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,264320811,ptdtc-sv-wzsrv2.portugal.pt,10.200.11.154,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:d3b7,Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7288-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7288-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,30,5,"Feb 25, 2025","Feb 24, 2025",Ubuntu,HIGH,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 22.04.5,'-,'-,26,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,236,,"#table cols=""3""

ocfs2_xa_value_truncate() with -ENOMEM.

In this case the comment mentions that we can return 0 if
ocfs2_xa_cleanup_value_truncate() is going to wipe the entry
anyway. But the following 'rc' check is wrong and execution flow do
'ocfs2_xa_remove_entry(loc);' twice:
* 1st: in ocfs2_xa_cleanup_value_truncate();
* 2nd: returning back to ocfs2_xa_remove() instead of going to 'out'.

This issue was also reported by syzbot.

It can be reproduced by following these steps(more details [1]):
1. Obtain more than 32 inputs that have similar hashes, which ends with the
   pattern '0xxxxxxxe6'.
2. Reboot and add the keys obtained in step 1.

The reproducer demonstrates how this issue happened:
1. In the search_nested_keyrings function, when it iterates through the
   slots in a node(below tag ascend_to_node), if the slot pointer is meta
   and node->back_pointer != NULL(it means a root), it will proceed to
   descend_to_node. However, there is an exception. If node is the root,
   and one of the slots points to a shortcut, it will be treated as a
   keyring.
2. Whether the ptr is keyring decided by keyring_ptr_is_keyring function.
   However, KEYRING_PTR_SUBTYPE is 0x2UL, the same as
   ASSOC_ARRAY_PTR_SUBTYPE_MASK.
3. When 32 keys with the similar hashes are added to the tree, the ROOT
   has keys with hashes that are not similar (e.g. slot 0) and it splits
   NODE A without using a shortcut. When NODE A is filled with keys that
   all hashes are xxe6, the keys are similar, NODE A will split with a
   shortcut. Finally, it forms the tree as shown below, where slot 6 points
   to a shortcut.

                      NODE A
              +------>+---+
      ROOT    |       | 0 | xxe6
      +---+   |       +---+
 xxxx | 0 | shortcut  :   : xxe6
      +---+   |       +---+
 xxe6 :   :   |       |   | xxe6
      +---+   |       +---+
      | 6 |---+       :   : xxe6
      +---+           +---+
 xxe6 :   :           | f | xxe6
      +---+           +---+
 xxe6 | f |
      +---+

4. As mentioned above, If a slot(slot 6) of the root points to a shortcut,
   it may be mistakenly transferred to a key*, leading to a read
   out-of-bounds read.

To fix this issue, one should jump to descend_to_node if the ptr is a
shortcut, regardless of whether the node is root or not.

CVE-2024-50141,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ACPI: PRM: Find EFI_MEMORY_RUNTIME block for PRM handler and context

PRMT needs to find the correct type of block to translate the PA-VA
mapping for EFI runtime services.

The issue arises because the PRMT is finding a block of type
EFI_CONVENTIONAL_MEMORY, which is not appropriate for runtime services
as described in Section 2.2.2 (Runtime Services) of the UEFI
Specification [1]. Since the PRM handler is a type of runtime service,
this causes an exception when the PRM handler is called.

    [Firmware Bug]: Unable to handle paging request in EFI runtime service
    WARNING: CPU: 22 PID: 4330 at drivers/firmware/efi/runtime-wrappers.c:341
        __efi_queue_work+0x11c/0x170
    Call trace:

Let PRMT find a block with EFI_MEMORY_RUNTIME for PRM handler and PRM
context.

If no suitable block is found, a warning message will be printed, but
the procedure continues to manage the next PRM handler.

However, if the PRM handler is actually called without proper allocation,
it would result in a failure during error handling.

By using the correct memory types for runtime services, ensure that the
PRM handler and the context are properly mapped in the virtual address
space during runtime, preventing the paging request error.

The issue is really that only memory that has been remapped for runtime
by the firmware can be used by the PRM handler, and so the region needs
to have the EFI_MEMORY_RUNTIME attribute.

So rq_qos_wake_function() calls wake_up_process(data->task), which calls
try_to_wake_up(), which faults in raw_spin_lock_irqsave(&p->pi_lock).

p comes from data->task, and data comes from the waitqueue entry, which
is stored on the waiter's stack in rq_qos_wait(). Analyzing the core
dump with drgn, I found that the waiter had already woken up and moved
on to a completely unrelated code path, clobbering what was previously
data->task. Meanwhile, the waker was passing the clobbered garbage in
data->task to wake_up_process(), leading to the crash.

What's happening is that in between rq_qos_wake_function() deleting the
waitqueue entry and calling wake_up_process(), rq_qos_wait() is finding
that it already got a token and returning. The race looks like this:

rq_qos_wait()                           rq_qos_wake_function()

if (data.got_token)
        break;
finish_wait(&rqw->wait, &data.wq);
  ^- returns immediately because
     list_empty_careful(&wq_entry->entry)
     is true
... return, go do something else ...

                                          (NO LONGER VALID!)-^

Normally, finish_wait() is supposed to synchronize against the waker.
But, as noted above, it is returning immediately because the waitqueue
entry has already been removed from the waitqueue.

The bug is that rq_qos_wake_function() is accessing the waitqueue entry
AFTER deleting it. Note that autoremove_wake_function() wakes the waiter
and THEN deletes the waitqueue entry, which is the proper order.

Fix it by swapping the order. We also need to use
list_del_init_careful() to match the list_empty_careful() in
finish_wait().",'-,4.7,6021689,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7288-1),4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,264320811,ptdtc-sv-wzsrv2.portugal.pt,10.200.11.154,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:d3b7,Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7288-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7288-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,30,5,"Feb 25, 2025","Feb 24, 2025",Ubuntu,HIGH,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 22.04.5,'-,'-,26,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,236,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-40953,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: Fix a data race on last_boosted_vcpu in kvm_vcpu_on_spin()

Use {READ,WRITE}_ONCE() to access kvm->last_boosted_vcpu to ensure the
loads and stores are atomic.  In the extremely unlikely scenario the
compiler tears the stores, it's theoretically possible for KVM to attempt
to get a vCPU using an out-of-bounds index, e.g. if the write is split
into multiple 8-bit stores, and is paired with a 32-bit load on a VM with
257 vCPUs:

  CPU0                              CPU1
  last_boosted_vcpu = 0xff;

                                    (last_boosted_vcpu = 0x100)
                                    last_boosted_vcpu[15:8] = 0x01;
  i = (last_boosted_vcpu = 0x1ff)
                                    last_boosted_vcpu[7:0] = 0x00;

  vcpu = kvm->vcpu_array[0x1ff];

CVE-2024-50115,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: nSVM: Ignore nCR3[4:0] when loading PDPTEs from memory

Ignore nCR3[4:0] when loading PDPTEs from memory for nested SVM, as bits
4:0 of CR3 are ignored when PAE paging is used, and thus VMRUN doesn't
enforce 32-byte alignment of nCR3.

In the absolute worst case scenario, failure to ignore bits 4:0 can result
in an out-of-bounds read, e.g. if the target page is at the end of a
memslot, and the VMM isn't using guard pages.

Per the APM:

  The CR3 register points to the base address of the page-directory-pointer
  table. The page-directory-pointer table is aligned on a 32-byte boundary,
  with the low 5 address bits 4:0 assumed to be 0.

And the SDM's much more explicit:

  4:0    Ignored

Note, KVM gets this right when loading PDPTRs, it's only the nSVM flow
that is broken.",'-,7.1,6021689,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7288-1),4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,264320811,ptdtc-sv-wzsrv2.portugal.pt,10.200.11.154,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:d3b7,Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7288-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7288-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,35,5,"Feb 25, 2025","Feb 24, 2025",Ubuntu,HIGH,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 22.04.5,'-,'-,26,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,236,,"#table cols=""3""

nilfs2: fix kernel bug due to missing clearing of buffer delay flag

Syzbot reported that after nilfs2 reads a corrupted file system image
and degrades to read-only, the BUG_ON check for the buffer delay flag
in submit_bh_wbc() may fail, causing a kernel bug.

This is because the buffer delay flag is not cleared when clearing the
buffer state flags to discard a page/folio or a buffer head. So, fix
this.

This became necessary when the use of nilfs2's own page clear routine
was expanded.  This state inconsistency does not occur if the buffer

wifi: iwlegacy: Clear stale interrupts before resuming device

iwl4965 fails upon resume from hibernation on my laptop. The reason
seems to be a stale interrupt which isn't being cleared out before
interrupts are enabled. We end up with a race beween the resume
trying to bring things back up, and the restart work (queued form
the interrupt handler) trying to bring things down. Eventually
the whole thing blows up.

Fix the problem by clearing out any stale interrupts before
interrupts get enabled during resume.

CVE-2024-50195,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

posix-clock: Fix missing timespec64 check in pc_clock_settime()

As Andrew pointed out, it will make sense that the PTP core
checked timespec64 struct's tv_sec and tv_nsec range before calling
ptp->info->settime64().

As the man manual of clock_settime() said, if tp.tv_sec is negative or
tp.tv_nsec is outside the range [0..999,999,999], it should return EINVAL,
which include dynamic clocks which handles PTP clock, and the condition is
consistent with timespec64_valid(). As Thomas suggested, timespec64_valid()
only check the timespec is valid, but not ensure that the time is
in a valid range, so check it ahead using timespec64_valid_strict()
in pc_clock_settime() and return -EINVAL if not valid.

There are some drivers that use tp->tv_sec and tp->tv_nsec directly to
write registers without validity checks and assume that the higher layer
has checked it, which is dangerous and will benefit from this, such as
hclge_ptp_settime(), igb_ptp_settime_i210(), _rcar_gen4_ptp_settime(),

CVE-2024-50196,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

pinctrl: ocelot: fix system hang on level based interrupts

The current implementation only calls chained_irq_enter() and
chained_irq_exit() if it detects pending interrupts.

```
for (i = 0; i < info->stride; i++) {
	uregmap_read(info->map, id_reg + 4 * i, &reg);
	if (!reg)
		continue;

	chained_irq_enter(parent_chip, desc);
```

However, in case of GPIO pin configured in level mode and the parent
controller configured in edge mode, GPIO interrupt might be lowered by the
hardware. In the result, if the interrupt is short enough, the parent
interrupt is still pending while the GPIO interrupt is cleared;
chained_irq_enter() never gets called and the system hangs trying to
service the parent interrupt.

Moving chained_irq_enter() and chained_irq_exit() outside the for loop
ensures that they are called even when GPIO interrupt is lowered by the
hardware.

The similar code with chained_irq_enter() / chained_irq_exit() functions
wrapping interrupt checking loop may be found in many other drivers:

Fixes copying of xfrm algorithms where some random
data of the structure fields can end up in userspace.
Padding in structures may be filled with random (possibly sensitve)
data and should never be given directly to user-space.

A similar issue was resolved in the commit
8222d5910dae (""xfrm: Zero padding when dumping algos and encap"")

CVE-2024-26718,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dm-crypt, dm-verity: disable tasklets

Tasklets have an inherent problem with memory corruption. The function
tasklet_action_common calls tasklet_trylock, then it calls the tasklet
callback and then it calls tasklet_unlock. If the tasklet callback frees
the structure that contains the tasklet or if it calls some code that may
free it, tasklet_unlock will write into free memory.

The commits 8e14f610159d and d9a02e016aaf try to fix it for dm-crypt, but
it is not a sufficient fix and the data corruption can still happen [1].
There is no fix for dm-verity and dm-verity will write into free memory
with every tasklet-processed bio.

There will be atomic workqueues implemented in the kernel 6.9 [2]. They
will have better interface and they will not suffer from the memory
corruption problem.

But we need something that stops the memory corruption now and that can be
backported to the stable kernels. So, I'm proposing this commit that
disables tasklets in both dm-crypt and dm-verity. This commit doesn't
remove the tasklet support, because the tasklet code will be reused when
atomic workqueues will be implemented.

This is because TFM is being used in parallel.

Fix this by allocating a new AEAD TFM for async decryption, but keep
the existing one for synchronous READ cases (similar to what is done
in smb3_calc_signature()).

Also remove the calls to aead_request_set_callback() and
crypto_wait_req() since it's always going to be a synchronous operation.",'-,7.8,358540,Amazon Linux Security Advisory for kernel : ALAS2023-2025-855,4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 24, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,197473531,ptaws-sv-mdprx1.portugal.pt,10.64.192.189,fe80:0:0:0:884:caff:fe9e:531d,"Please refer to Amazon advisory: ALAS2023-2025-855 for affected packages and patching details, or update with your package manager.(https://alas.aws.amazon.com/AL2023/ALAS-2025-855.html)","PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,35,6,"Feb 24, 2025","Feb 12, 2025",Amazon Linux,HIGH,High Lateral Movement,Amazon Linux 2023.6.20250218,'-,'-,33,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a securitybreach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,14,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-51744,"golang-jwt is a Go implementation of JSON Web Tokens. Unclear documentation of the error behavior in `ParseWithClaims` can lead to situation where users are potentially not checking errors in the way they should be. Especially, if a token is both expired and invalid, the errors returned by `ParseWithClaims` return both error codes. If users only check for the `jwt.ErrTokenExpired ` using `error.Is`, they will ignore the embedded `jwt.ErrTokenSignatureInvalid` and thus potentially accept invalid tokens. A fix has been back-ported with the error handling logic from the `v5` branch to the `v4` branch. In this logic, the `ParseWithClaims` function will immediately return in ""dangerous"" situations (e.g., an invalid signature), limiting the combined errors only to situations where the signature is valid, but further validation failed (e.g., if the signature is valid, but is expired AND has the wrong audience). This fix is part of the 4.5.1 release. We are aware that this changes the behaviour of an established function and is not 100 % backwards compatible, so updating to 4.5.1 might break your code.

CVE-2025-0714,"The vulnerability exists in the password storage of Mobateks MobaXterm in versions below 25.0. MobaXTerm uses an initialisation vector (IV) consisting only of zero bytes and a master key to encrypt each password individually. In the default configuration, on opening MobaXTerm, the user is prompted for their password. A derivative of the password is used as the master key. As both the master key and the IV are the same for each stored password, the AES CFB ciphertext depends only on the plaintext (the password). The static IV and master key make it easier to obtain sensitive information and to decrypt data when it is stored at rest.",'-,'-,382873,MobaTek MobaXterm Sensitive Information Disclosure Vulnerability (CVE-2025-0714),3,3,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 26, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,142523680,SPPUNIMGT01V.czech.lan,10.226.24.4,,"The vendor has issued a fix in v25, kindly refer advisory for more details

CVE-2024-51744,"golang-jwt is a Go implementation of JSON Web Tokens. Unclear documentation of the error behavior in `ParseWithClaims` can lead to situation where users are potentially not checking errors in the way they should be. Especially, if a token is both expired and invalid, the errors returned by `ParseWithClaims` return both error codes. If users only check for the `jwt.ErrTokenExpired ` using `error.Is`, they will ignore the embedded `jwt.ErrTokenSignatureInvalid` and thus potentially accept invalid tokens. A fix has been back-ported with the error handling logic from the `v5` branch to the `v4` branch. In this logic, the `ParseWithClaims` function will immediately return in ""dangerous"" situations (e.g., an invalid signature), limiting the combined errors only to situations where the signature is valid, but further validation failed (e.g., if the signature is valid, but is expired AND has the wrong audience). This fix is part of the 4.5.1 release. We are aware that this changes the behaviour of an established function and is not 100 % backwards compatible, so updating to 4.5.1 might break your code. In case you cannot update to 4.5.0, please make sure that you are properly checking for all errors (""dangerous"" ones first), so that you are not running in the case detailed above.",'-,'-,358562,Amazon Linux Security Advisory for docker : ALAS2NITRO-ENCLAVES-2025-050,2,2,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 27, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,197478877,ptaws-sv-uht1.portugal.pt,"10.64.192.237,172.17.0.1,172.22.0.1","fe80:0:0:0:42:16ff:fee5:16,fe80:0:0:0:42:baff:fe33:e42,fe80:0:0:0:809:fbff:fea5:6821,fe80:0:0:0:14ac:e2ff:fe69:a5c7,fe80:0:0:0:2882:76ff:fecb:929d,fe80:0:0:0:4c52:8eff:fe8f:8c76,fe80:0:0:0:5421:4dff:fe20:e3d0,fe80:0:0:0:6095:acff:feaa:ed76,fe80:0:0:0:6c29:60ff:feae:a97f,fe80:0:0:0:90e8:36ff:fe42:ee89,fe80:0:0:0:9c24:63ff:fe32:172b,fe80:0:0:0:a450:21ff:fe64:9be1,fe80:0:0:0:ac75:15ff:fe42:d2fd,fe80:0:0:0:b897:dbff:fe4c:1050,fe80:0:0:0:fcc0:94ff:fee8:5c48","Please refer to Amazon advisory: ALAS2NITRO-ENCLAVES-2025-050 for affected packages and patching details, or update with your package manager.(https://alas.aws.amazon.com/AL2/ALASNITRO-ENCLAVES-2025-050.html)","PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,20,4,"Feb 26, 2025","Feb 12, 2025",Amazon Linux,LOW,High Lateral Movement,Amazon Linux 2,'-,'-,9,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a securitybreach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,246,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-51744,"golang-jwt is a Go implementation of JSON Web Tokens. Unclear documentation of the error behavior in `ParseWithClaims` can lead to situation where users are potentially not checking errors in the way they should be. Especially, if a token is both expired and invalid, the errors returned by `ParseWithClaims` return both error codes. If users only check for the `jwt.ErrTokenExpired ` using `error.Is`, they will ignore the embedded `jwt.ErrTokenSignatureInvalid` and thus potentially accept invalid tokens. A fix has been back-ported with the error handling logic from the `v5` branch to the `v4` branch. In this logic, the `ParseWithClaims` function will immediately return in ""dangerous"" situations (e.g., an invalid signature), limiting the combined errors only to situations where the signature is valid, but further validation failed (e.g., if the signature is valid, but is expired AND has the wrong audience). This fix is part of the 4.5.1 release. We are aware that this changes the behaviour of an established function and is not 100 % backwards compatible, so updating to 4.5.1 might break your code.

tipc: guard against string buffer overrun

Smatch reports that copying media_name and if_name to name_parts may
overwrite the destination.

CVE-2024-41066,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ibmvnic: Add tx check to prevent skb leak

Below is a summary of how the driver stores a reference to an skb during
transmit:
    tx_buff[free_map[consumer_index]]->skb = new_skb;
    free_map[consumer_index] = IBMVNIC_INVALID_MAP;
    consumer_index ++;
Where variable data looks like this:
    free_map == [4, IBMVNIC_INVALID_MAP, IBMVNIC_INVALID_MAP, 0, 3]
                                               	consumer_index^
    tx_buff == [skb=null, skb=<ptr>, skb=<ptr>, skb=null, skb=null]

The driver has checks to ensure that free_map[consumer_index] pointed to
a valid index but there was no check to ensure that this index pointed
to an unused/null skb address. So, if, by some chance, our free_map and
tx_buff lists become out of sync then we were previously risking an
skb memory leak. This could then cause tcp congestion control to stop
sending packets, eventually leading to ETIMEDOUT.

Therefore, add a conditional to ensure that the skb address is null. If
not then warn the user (because this is still a bug that should be
patched) and free the old pointer to prevent memleak/tcp problems.",'-,5.5,6021727,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7293-1),5,5,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 27, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,125231216,ptprt-srv-espap,10.200.1.21,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:24,Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7293-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7293-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT,Group-3",No,No,30,4,"Feb 26, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",Ubuntu,CRITICAL,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 20.04.6,'-,'-,24,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,238,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-47696,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/iwcm: Fix WARNING:at_kernel/workqueue.c:#check_flush_dependency

In the commit aee2424246f9 (""RDMA/iwcm: Fix a use-after-free related to
destroying CM IDs""), the function flush_workqueue is invoked to flush the
work queue iwcm_wq.

But at that time, the work queue iwcm_wq was created via the function
alloc_ordered_workqueue without the flag WQ_MEM_RECLAIM.

Because the current process is trying to flush the whole iwcm_wq, if
iwcm_wq doesn't have the flag WQ_MEM_RECLAIM, verify that the current
process is not reclaiming memory or running on a workqueue which doesn't
have the flag WQ_MEM_RECLAIM as that can break forward-progress guarantee
leading to a deadlock.

CVE-2024-49867,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: wait for fixup workers before stopping cleaner kthread during umount

During unmount, at close_ctree(), we have the following steps in this order:

1) Park the cleaner kthread - this doesn't destroy the kthread, it basically
   halts its execution (wake ups against it work but do nothing);

2) We stop the cleaner kthread - this results in freeing the respective
   struct task_struct;

3) We call btrfs_stop_all_workers() which waits for any jobs running in all
   the work queues and then free the work queues.

Syzbot reported a case where a fixup worker resulted in a crash when doing
a delayed iput on its inode while attempting to wake up the cleaner at
btrfs_add_delayed_iput(), because the task_struct of the cleaner kthread
was already freed. This can happen during unmount because we don't wait
for any fixup workers still running before we call kthread_stop() against
the cleaner kthread, which stops and free all its resources.

Fix this by waiting for any fixup workers at close_ctree() before we call
kthread_stop() against the cleaner and run pending delayed iputs.

The stack traces reported by syzbot were the following:

[CAUSE]
The allocation failure happens at the start_transaction() inside
prepare_to_relocate(), and during the error handling we call
unset_reloc_control(), which makes fs_info->balance_ctl to be NULL.

Then we continue the error path cleanup in btrfs_balance() by calling
reset_balance_state() which will call del_balance_item() to fully delete
the balance item in the root tree.

However during the small window between set_reloc_contrl() and
unset_reloc_control(), we can have a subvolume tree update and created a
reloc_root for that subvolume.

Then we go into the final btrfs_commit_transaction() of
del_balance_item(), and into btrfs_update_reloc_root() inside
commit_fs_roots().

That function checks if fs_info->reloc_ctl is in the merge_reloc_tree
stage, but since fs_info->reloc_ctl is NULL, it results a NULL pointer
dereference.

[FIX]
Just add extra check on fs_info->reloc_ctl inside
btrfs_update_reloc_root(), before checking
fs_info->reloc_ctl->merge_reloc_tree.

media: dvbdev: prevent the risk of out of memory access

The dvbdev contains a static variable used to store dvb minors.

The behavior of it depends if CONFIG_DVB_DYNAMIC_MINORS is set
or not. When not set, dvb_register_device() won't check for
boundaries, as it will rely that a previous call to
dvb_register_adapter() would already be enforcing it.

On a similar way, dvb_device_open() uses the assumption
that the register functions already did the needed checks.

This can be fragile if some device ends using different
calls. This also generate warnings on static check analysers
like Coverity.

Currently we have a global spi_add_lock which we take when adding new
devices so that we can check that we're not trying to reuse a chip
select that's already controlled.  This means that if the SPI device is
itself a SPI controller and triggers the instantiation of further SPI
devices we trigger a deadlock as we try to register and instantiate
those devices while in the process of doing so for the parent controller
and hence already holding the global spi_add_lock.  Since we only care
about concurrency within a single SPI bus move the lock to be per
controller, avoiding the deadlock.

CVE-2024-50194,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64: probes: Fix uprobes for big-endian kernels

The arm64 uprobes code is broken for big-endian kernels as it doesn't
convert the in-memory instruction encoding (which is always
little-endian) into the kernel's native endianness before analyzing and
simulating instructions. This may result in a few distinct problems:

* The kernel may may erroneously reject probing an instruction which can
  safely be probed.

* The kernel may erroneously erroneously permit stepping an
  instruction out-of-line when that instruction cannot be stepped
  out-of-line safely.

* The kernel may erroneously simulate instruction incorrectly dur to
  interpretting the byte-swapped encoding.

The endianness mismatch isn't caught by the compiler or sparse because:

* The arch_uprobe::{insn,ixol} fields are encoded as arrays of u8, so
  the compiler and sparse have no idea these contain a little-endian
  32-bit value. The core uprobes code populates these with a memcpy()
  which similarly does not handle endianness.

* While the uprobe_opcode_t type is an alias for __le32, both
  arch_uprobe_analyze_insn() and arch_uprobe_skip_sstep() cast from u8[]
  to the similarly-named probe_opcode_t, which is an alias for u32.
  Hence there is no endianness conversion warning.

Fix this by changing the arch_uprobe::{insn,ixol} fields to __le32 and
adding the appropriate __le32_to_cpu() conversions prior to consuming
the instruction encoding. The core uprobes copies these fields as opaque
ranges of bytes, and so is unaffected by this change.

At the same time, remove MAX_UINSN_BYTES and consistently use
AARCH64_INSN_SIZE for clarity.

CVE-2024-47740,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

f2fs: Require FMODE_WRITE for atomic write ioctls

The F2FS ioctls for starting and committing atomic writes check for
inode_owner_or_capable(), but this does not give LSMs like SELinux or
Landlock an opportunity to deny the write access - if the caller's FSUID
matches the inode's UID, inode_owner_or_capable() immediately returns true.

There are scenarios where LSMs want to deny a process the ability to write
particular files, even files that the FSUID of the process owns; but this
can currently partially be bypassed using atomic write ioctls in two ways:

 - F2FS_IOC_START_ATOMIC_REPLACE + F2FS_IOC_COMMIT_ATOMIC_WRITE can
   truncate an inode to size 0
 - F2FS_IOC_START_ATOMIC_WRITE + F2FS_IOC_ABORT_ATOMIC_WRITE can revert
   changes another process concurrently made to a file

nilfs2: fix potential null-ptr-deref in nilfs_btree_insert()

Patch series ""nilfs2: fix potential issues with empty b-tree nodes"".

This series addresses three potential issues with empty b-tree nodes that
can occur with corrupted filesystem images, including one recently
discovered by syzbot.


This patch (of 3):

If a b-tree is broken on the device, and the b-tree height is greater than
2 (the level of the root node is greater than 1) even if the number of
child nodes of the b-tree root is 0, a NULL pointer dereference occurs in
nilfs_btree_prepare_insert(), which is called from nilfs_btree_insert().

This is because, when the number of child nodes of the b-tree root is 0,
nilfs_btree_do_lookup() does not set the block buffer head in any of
path[x].bp_bh, leaving it as the initial value of NULL, but if the level
of the b-tree root node is greater than 1, nilfs_btree_get_nonroot_node(),
which accesses the buffer memory of path[x].bp_bh, is called.

Fix this issue by adding a check to nilfs_btree_root_broken(), which
performs sanity checks when reading the root node from the device, to
detect this inconsistency.

CVE-2024-49878,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

resource: fix region_intersects() vs add_memory_driver_managed()

On a system with CXL memory, the resource tree (/proc/iomem) related to
CXL memory may look like something as follows.

490000000-50fffffff : CXL Window 0
  490000000-50fffffff : region0
    490000000-50fffffff : dax0.0
      490000000-50fffffff : System RAM (kmem)

Because drivers/dax/kmem.c calls add_memory_driver_managed() during
onlining CXL memory, which makes ""System RAM (kmem)"" a descendant of ""CXL
Window X"".  This confuses region_intersects(), which expects all ""System
RAM"" resources to be at the top level of iomem_resource.  This can lead to
bugs.

For example, when the following command line is executed to write some
memory in CXL memory range via /dev/mem,

 $ dd if=data of=/dev/mem bs=$((1 << 10)) seek=$((0x490000000 >> 10)) count=1
 dd: error writing '/dev/mem': Bad address
 1+0 records in
 0+0 records out
 0 bytes copied, 0.0283507 s, 0.0 kB/s

the command fails as expected.  However, the error code is wrong.  It
should be ""Operation not permitted"" instead of ""Bad address"".  More
seriously, the /dev/mem permission checking in devmem_is_allowed() passes
incorrectly.  Although the accessing is prevented later because ioremap()
isn't allowed to map system RAM, it is a potential security issue.  During
command executing, the following warning is reported in the kernel log for
calling ioremap() on system RAM.

 ioremap on RAM at 0x0000000490000000 - 0x0000000490000fff

  entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x4b/0x53

The details of command execution process are as follows.  In the above
resource tree, ""System RAM"" is a descendant of ""CXL Window 0"" instead of a
top level resource.  So, region_intersects() will report no System RAM
resources in the CXL memory region incorrectly, because it only checks the
top level resources.  Consequently, devmem_is_allowed() will return 1
(allow access via /dev/mem) for CXL memory region incorrectly. 
Fortunately, ioremap() doesn't allow to map System RAM and reject the
access.

So, region_intersects() needs to be fixed to work correctly with the
resource tree with ""System RAM"" not at top level as above.  To fix it, if
we found a unmatched resource in the top level, we will continue to search
matched resources in its descendant resources.  So, we will not miss any
matched resources in resource tree anymore.

In the new implementation, an example resource tree

|------------- ""CXL Window 0"" ------------|

region_intersects(, IORESOURCE_SYSTEM_RAM, ),

fs_reclaim pseudo lock.

This is because after commit 21fc61c73c39 (""don't put symlink bodies in
pagecache into highmem""), the gfp flags of the page cache for symbolic
links are overwritten to GFP_KERNEL via inode_nohighmem().

This is not a problem for symlinks read from the backing device, because
the __GFP_FS flag is dropped after inode_nohighmem() is called.  However,
when a new symlink is created with nilfs_symlink(), the gfp flags remain
overwritten to GFP_KERNEL.  Then, memory allocation called from
page_symlink() etc.  triggers memory reclamation including the FS layer,
which may call nilfs_evict_inode() or nilfs_dirty_inode().  And these can
cause a deadlock if they are called while nilfs->ns_segctor_sem is held:

Fix this issue by dropping the __GFP_FS flag from the page cache GFP flags
of newly created symlinks in the same way that nilfs_new_inode() and
__nilfs_read_inode() do, as a workaround until we adopt nofs allocation
scope consistently or improve the locking constraints.",'-,5.5,6021727,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7293-1),5,5,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 27, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,125231216,ptprt-srv-espap,10.200.1.21,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:24,Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7293-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7293-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT,Group-3",No,No,30,4,"Feb 26, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",Ubuntu,CRITICAL,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 20.04.6,'-,'-,24,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,238,,"#table cols=""3""

drm/vmwgfx: Fix a deadlock in dma buf fence polling

Introduce a version of the fence ops that on release doesn't remove
the fence from the pending list, and thus doesn't require a lock to
fix poll->fence wait->fence unref deadlocks.

vmwgfx overwrites the wait callback to iterate over the list of all
fences and update their status, to do that it holds a lock to prevent
the list modifcations from other threads. The fence destroy callback
both deletes the fence and removes it from the list of pending
fences, for which it holds a lock.

dma buf polling cb unrefs a fence after it's been signaled: so the poll
calls the wait, which signals the fences, which are being destroyed.
The destruction tries to acquire the lock on the pending fences list
which it can never get because it's held by the wait from which it
was called.

mm: avoid leaving partial pfn mappings around in error case

As Jann points out, PFN mappings are special, because unlike normal
memory mappings, there is no lifetime information associated with the
mapping - it is just a raw mapping of PFNs with no reference counting of
a 'struct page'.

That's all very much intentional, but it does mean that it's easy to
mess up the cleanup in case of errors.  Yes, a failed mmap() will always
eventually clean up any partial mappings, but without any explicit
lifetime in the page table mapping itself, it's very easy to do the
error handling in the wrong order.

In particular, it's easy to mistakenly free the physical backing store
before the page tables are actually cleaned up and (temporarily) have
stale dangling PTE entries.

To make this situation less error-prone, just make sure that any partial
pfn mapping is torn down early, before any other error handling.",'-,5.5,6021727,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7293-1),5,5,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 27, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,125231216,ptprt-srv-espap,10.200.1.21,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:24,Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7293-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7293-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT,Group-3",No,No,37,4,"Feb 26, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",Ubuntu,CRITICAL,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 20.04.6,'-,'-,24,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,238,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-50039,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/sched: accept TCA_STAB only for root qdisc

Most qdiscs maintain their backlog using qdisc_pkt_len(skb)
on the assumption it is invariant between the enqueue()
and dequeue() handlers.

Unfortunately syzbot can crash a host rather easily using
a TBF + SFQ combination, with an STAB on SFQ [1]

We can't support TCA_STAB on arbitrary level, this would
require to maintain per-qdisc storage.

CVE-2024-47706,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

block, bfq: fix possible UAF for bfqq->bic with merge chain

1) initial state, three tasks:

		Process 1       Process 2	Process 3
		 (BIC1)          (BIC2)		 (BIC3)
		  |  ?            |  ?		  |  ?
		  |  |            |  |		  |  |
		  V  |            V  |		  V  |
		  bfqq1           bfqq2		  bfqq3
process ref:	   1		    1		    1

2) bfqq1 merged to bfqq2:

		Process 1       Process 2	Process 3
		 (BIC1)          (BIC2)		 (BIC3)
		  |               |		  |  ?
		  \--------------\|		  |  |
		                  V		  V  |
		  bfqq1--------->bfqq2		  bfqq3
process ref:	   0		    2		    1

3) bfqq2 merged to bfqq3:

		Process 1       Process 2	Process 3
		 (BIC1)          (BIC2)		 (BIC3)
	 here -> ?                |		  |
		  \--------------\ \-------------\|
		                  V		  V
		  bfqq1--------->bfqq2---------->bfqq3
process ref:	   0		    1		    3

In this case, IO from Process 1 will get bfqq2 from BIC1 first, and then
get bfqq3 through merge chain, and finially handle IO by bfqq3.
Howerver, current code will think bfqq2 is owned by BIC1, like initial
state, and set bfqq2->bic to BIC1.

bfq_insert_request
-> by Process 1
 bfqq = bfq_init_rq(rq)
  bfqq = bfq_get_bfqq_handle_split
   bfqq = bic_to_bfqq
   -> get bfqq2 from BIC1
 bfqq->ref++
 rq->elv.priv[0] = bic
 rq->elv.priv[1] = bfqq
 if (bfqq_process_refs(bfqq) == 1)
  bfqq->bic = bic
  -> record BIC1 to bfqq2

  __bfq_insert_request
   new_bfqq = bfq_setup_cooperator
   -> get bfqq3 from bfqq2->new_bfqq
   bfqq_request_freed(bfqq)
   new_bfqq->ref++
   rq->elv.priv[1] = new_bfqq
   -> handle IO by bfqq3

Fix the problem by checking bfqq is from merge chain fist. And this
might fix a following problem reported by our syzkaller(unreproducible):

CVE-2024-50278,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dm cache: fix potential out-of-bounds access on the first resume

Out-of-bounds access occurs if the fast device is expanded unexpectedly
before the first-time resume of the cache table. This happens because
expanding the fast device requires reloading the cache table for
cache_create to allocate new in-core data structures that fit the new
size, and the check in cache_preresume is not performed during the
first resume, leading to the issue.

Reproduce steps:

1. prepare component devices:

dmsetup create cmeta --table ""0 8192 linear /dev/sdc 0""
dmsetup create cdata --table ""0 65536 linear /dev/sdc 8192""
dmsetup create corig --table ""0 524288 linear /dev/sdc 262144""
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/mapper/cmeta bs=4k count=1 oflag=direct

2. load a cache table of 512 cache blocks, and deliberately expand the
   fast device before resuming the cache, making the in-core data
   structures inadequate.

dmsetup create cache --notable
dmsetup reload cache --table ""0 524288 cache /dev/mapper/cmeta \
/dev/mapper/cdata /dev/mapper/corig 128 2 metadata2 writethrough smq 0""
dmsetup reload cdata --table ""0 131072 linear /dev/sdc 8192""
dmsetup resume cdata
dmsetup resume cache

3. suspend the cache to write out the in-core dirty bitset and hint
   array, leading to out-of-bounds access to the dirty bitset at offset
   0x40:

dmsetup suspend cache

CVE-2024-50273,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: reinitialize delayed ref list after deleting it from the list

At insert_delayed_ref() if we need to update the action of an existing
ref to BTRFS_DROP_DELAYED_REF, we delete the ref from its ref head's
ref_add_list using list_del(), which leaves the ref's add_list member
not reinitialized, as list_del() sets the next and prev members of the
list to LIST_POISON1 and LIST_POISON2, respectively.

If later we end up calling drop_delayed_ref() against the ref, which can
happen during merging or when destroying delayed refs due to a transaction
abort, we can trigger a crash since at drop_delayed_ref() we call
list_empty() against the ref's add_list, which returns false since
the list was not reinitialized after the list_del() and as a consequence
we call list_del() again at drop_delayed_ref(). This results in an
invalid list access since the next and prev members are set to poison
pointers, resulting in a splat if CONFIG_LIST_HARDENED and
CONFIG_DEBUG_LIST are set or invalid poison pointer dereferences
otherwise.

slhc_remember() only checked the size of the packet was at least 20,
which is not good enough.

We need to make sure the packet includes the IPv4 and TCP header
that are supposed to be carried.

Add iph and th pointers to make the code more readable.

i2c: stm32f7: Do not prepare/unprepare clock during runtime suspend/resume

In case there is any sort of clock controller attached to this I2C bus
controller, for example Versaclock or even an AIC32x4 I2C codec, then
an I2C transfer triggered from the clock controller clk_ops .prepare
callback may trigger a deadlock on drivers/clk/clk.c prepare_lock mutex.

This is because the clock controller first grabs the prepare_lock mutex
and then performs the prepare operation, including its I2C access. The
I2C access resumes this I2C bus controller via .runtime_resume callback,
which calls clk_prepare_enable(), which attempts to grab the prepare_lock
mutex again and deadlocks.

Since the clock are already prepared since probe() and unprepared in
remove(), use simple clk_enable()/clk_disable() calls to enable and
disable the clock on runtime suspend and resume, to avoid hitting the
prepare_lock mutex.",'-,5.5,6021727,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7293-1),5,5,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 27, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,125231216,ptprt-srv-espap,10.200.1.21,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:24,Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7293-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7293-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT,Group-3",No,No,30,4,"Feb 26, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",Ubuntu,CRITICAL,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 20.04.6,'-,'-,24,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,238,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-49982,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

aoe: fix the potential use-after-free problem in more places

For fixing CVE-2023-6270, f98364e92662 (""aoe: fix the potential
use-after-free problem in aoecmd_cfg_pkts"") makes tx() calling dev_put()
instead of doing in aoecmd_cfg_pkts(). It avoids that the tx() runs
into use-after-free.

Then Nicolai Stange found more places in aoe have potential use-after-free
problem with tx(). e.g. revalidate(), aoecmd_ata_rw(), resend(), probe()
and aoecmd_cfg_rsp(). Those functions also use aoenet_xmit() to push
packet to tx queue. So they should also use dev_hold() to increase the
refcnt of skb->dev.

On the other hand, moving dev_put() to tx() causes that the refcnt of
skb->dev be reduced to a negative value, because corresponding

In the `wilc_parse_join_bss_param` function, the TSF field of the `ies`

CVE-2024-47679,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vfs: fix race between evice_inodes() and find_inode()&iput()

Hi, all

Recently I noticed a bug[1] in btrfs, after digged it into
and I believe it'a race in vfs.

Let's assume there's a inode (ie ino 261) with i_count 1 is
called by iput(), and there's a concurrent thread calling
generic_shutdown_super().

cpu0:                              cpu1:
iput() // i_count is 1
  ->spin_lock(inode)
  ->dec i_count to 0
  ->iput_final()                    generic_shutdown_super()
    ->__inode_add_lru()               ->evict_inodes()
      // cause some reason[2]           ->if (atomic_read(inode->i_count)) continue;
      // return before                  // inode 261 passed the above check
      // list_lru_add_obj()             // and then schedule out
   ->spin_unlock()
// note here: the inode 261
// was still at sb list and hash list,
// and I_FREEING|I_WILL_FREE was not been set

btrfs_iget()
  // after some function calls
  ->find_inode()
    // found the above inode 261
    ->spin_lock(inode)
   // check I_FREEING|I_WILL_FREE
   // and passed
      ->__iget()
    ->spin_unlock(inode)                // schedule back
                                        ->spin_lock(inode)
                                        // check (I_NEW|I_FREEING|I_WILL_FREE) flags,
                                        // passed and set I_FREEING
iput()                                  ->spin_unlock(inode)
  ->spin_lock(inode)			  ->evict()
  // dec i_count to 0
  ->iput_final()
    ->spin_unlock()
    ->evict()

Now, we have two threads simultaneously evicting
the same inode, which may trigger the BUG(inode->i_state & I_CLEAR)
statement both within clear_inode() and iput().

To fix the bug, recheck the inode->i_count after holding i_lock.
Because in the most scenarios, the first check is valid, and
the overhead of spin_lock() can be reduced.

If there is any misunderstanding, please let me know, thanks.

CVE-2024-50045,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: br_netfilter: fix panic with metadata_dst skb

Fix a kernel panic in the br_netfilter module when sending untagged
traffic via a VxLAN device.
This happens during the check for fragmentation in br_nf_dev_queue_xmit.

It is dependent on:
1) the br_netfilter module being loaded;
2) net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables set to 1;
3) a bridge with a VxLAN (single-vxlan-device) netdevice as a bridge port;
4) untagged frames with size higher than the VxLAN MTU forwarded/flooded

When forwarding the untagged packet to the VxLAN bridge port, before
the netfilter hooks are called, br_handle_egress_vlan_tunnel is called and
changes the skb_dst to the tunnel dst. The tunnel_dst is a metadata type
of dst, i.e., skb_valid_dst(skb) is false, and metadata->dst.dev is NULL.

Then in the br_netfilter hooks, in br_nf_dev_queue_xmit, there's a check
for frames that needs to be fragmented: frames with higher MTU than the
VxLAN device end up calling br_nf_ip_fragment, which in turns call
ip_skb_dst_mtu.

The ip_dst_mtu tries to use the skb_dst(skb) as if it was a valid dst
with valid dst->dev, thus the crash.

This case was never supported in the first place, so drop the packet
instead.

nilfs2: propagate directory read errors from nilfs_find_entry()

Syzbot reported that a task hang occurs in vcs_open() during a fuzzing
test for nilfs2.

The root cause of this problem is that in nilfs_find_entry(), which
searches for directory entries, ignores errors when loading a directory
page/folio via nilfs_get_folio() fails.

If the filesystem images is corrupted, and the i_size of the directory
inode is large, and the directory page/folio is successfully read but
fails the sanity check, for example when it is zero-filled,
nilfs_check_folio() may continue to spit out error messages in bursts.

Fix this issue by propagating the error to the callers when loading a
page/folio fails in nilfs_find_entry().

The current interface of nilfs_find_entry() and its callers is outdated
and cannot propagate error codes such as -EIO and -ENOMEM returned via
nilfs_find_entry(), so fix it together.",'-,5.5,6021727,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7293-1),5,5,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 27, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,125231216,ptprt-srv-espap,10.200.1.21,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:24,Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7293-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7293-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT,Group-3",No,No,30,4,"Feb 26, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",Ubuntu,CRITICAL,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 20.04.6,'-,'-,24,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,238,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-49949,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: avoid potential underflow in qdisc_pkt_len_init() with UFO

After commit 7c6d2ecbda83 (""net: be more gentle about silly gso
requests coming from user"") virtio_net_hdr_to_skb() had sanity check
to detect malicious attempts from user space to cook a bad GSO packet.

Then commit cf9acc90c80ec (""net: virtio_net_hdr_to_skb: count
transport header in UFO"") while fixing one issue, allowed user space
to cook a GSO packet with the following characteristic :

IPv4 SKB_GSO_UDP, gso_size=3, skb->len = 28.

When this packet arrives in qdisc_pkt_len_init(), we end up
with hdr_len = 28 (IPv4 header + UDP header), matching skb->len

Then the following sets gso_segs to 0 :

gso_segs = DIV_ROUND_UP(skb->len - hdr_len,
                        shinfo->gso_size);

Then later we set qdisc_skb_cb(skb)->pkt_len to back to zero :/

qdisc_skb_cb(skb)->pkt_len += (gso_segs - 1) * hdr_len;

This leads to the following crash in fq_codel [1]

qdisc_pkt_len_init() is best effort, we only want an estimation
of the bytes sent on the wire, not crashing the kernel.

This patch is fixing this particular issue, a following one
adds more sanity checks for another potential bug.

gpio: prevent potential speculation leaks in gpio_device_get_desc()

Userspace may trigger a speculative read of an address outside the gpio
descriptor array.

Offset is copied from user and then used as an array index to get

CVE-2024-50099,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64: probes: Remove broken LDR (literal) uprobe support

The simulate_ldr_literal() and simulate_ldrsw_literal() functions are
unsafe to use for uprobes. Both functions were originally written for
use with kprobes, and access memory with plain C accesses. When uprobes
was added, these were reused unmodified even though they cannot safely
access user memory.

There are three key problems:

1) The plain C accesses do not have corresponding extable entries, and
   thus if they encounter a fault the kernel will treat these as
   unintentional accesses to user memory, resulting in a BUG() which
   will kill the kernel thread, and likely lead to further issues (e.g.
   lockup or panic()).

2) The plain C accesses are subject to HW PAN and SW PAN, and so when
   either is in use, any attempt to simulate an access to user memory
   will fault. Thus neither simulate_ldr_literal() nor
   simulate_ldrsw_literal() can do anything useful when simulating a
   user instruction on any system with HW PAN or SW PAN.

3) The plain C accesses are privileged, as they run in kernel context,
   and in practice can access a small range of kernel virtual addresses.
   The instructions they simulate have a range of +/-1MiB, and since the
   simulated instructions must itself be a user instructions in the
   TTBR0 address range, these can address the final 1MiB of the TTBR1
   acddress range by wrapping downwards from an address in the first
   1MiB of the TTBR0 address range.

   In contemporary kernels the last 8MiB of TTBR1 address range is
   reserved, and accesses to this will always fault, meaning this is no
   worse than (1).

   Historically, it was theoretically possible for the linear map or
   vmemmap to spill into the final 8MiB of the TTBR1 address range, but
   in practice this is extremely unlikely to occur as this would
   require either:

   * Having enough physical memory to fill the entire linear map all the
     way to the final 1MiB of the TTBR1 address range.

   * Getting unlucky with KASLR randomization of the linear map such
     that the populated region happens to overlap with the last 1MiB of
     the TTBR address range.

   ... and in either case if we were to spill into the final page there
   would be larger problems as the final page would alias with error
   pointers.

Practically speaking, (1) and (2) are the big issues. Given there have
been no reports of problems since the broken code was introduced, it
appears that no-one is relying on probing these instructions with
uprobes.

Avoid these issues by not allowing uprobes on LDR (literal) and LDRSW
(literal), limiting the use of simulate_ldr_literal() and
simulate_ldrsw_literal() to kprobes. Attempts to place uprobes on LDR
(literal) and LDRSW (literal) will be rejected as
arm_probe_decode_insn() will return INSN_REJECTED. In future we can
consider introducing working uprobes support for these instructions, but
this will require more significant work.",'-,5.5,6021727,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7293-1),5,5,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 27, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,125231216,ptprt-srv-espap,10.200.1.21,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:24,Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7293-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7293-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT,Group-3",No,No,30,4,"Feb 26, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",Ubuntu,CRITICAL,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 20.04.6,'-,'-,24,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,238,,"#table cols=""3""

mailbox: bcm2835: Fix timeout during suspend mode

During noirq suspend phase the Raspberry Pi power driver suffer of
firmware property timeouts. The reason is that the IRQ of the underlying
BCM2835 mailbox is disabled and rpi_firmware_property_list() will always
run into a timeout [1].

Since the VideoCore side isn't consider as a wakeup source, set the
IRQF_NO_SUSPEND flag for the mailbox IRQ in order to keep it enabled
during suspend-resume cycle.

The issue was in the reflink workfow while reserving space for inline
xattr.  The problematic function is ocfs2_reflink_xattr_inline().  By the
time this function is called the reflink tree is already recreated at the
destination inode from the source inode.  At this point, this function
reserves space for inline xattrs at the destination inode without even
checking if there is space at the root metadata block.  It simply reduces
the l_count from 243 to 227 thereby making space of 256 bytes for inline
xattr whereas the inode already has extents beyond this index (in this
case up to 230), thereby causing corruption.

The fix for this is to reserve space for inline metadata at the destination
inode before the reflink tree gets recreated. The customer has verified the
fix.",'-,5.5,6021727,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7293-1),5,5,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 27, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,125231216,ptprt-srv-espap,10.200.1.21,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:24,Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7293-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7293-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT,Group-3",No,No,30,4,"Feb 26, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",Ubuntu,CRITICAL,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 20.04.6,'-,'-,24,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,238,,"#table cols=""3""

This issue was also reported by syzbot.

It can be reproduced by following these steps(more details [1]):
1. Obtain more than 32 inputs that have similar hashes, which ends with the
   pattern '0xxxxxxxe6'.
2. Reboot and add the keys obtained in step 1.

The reproducer demonstrates how this issue happened:
1. In the search_nested_keyrings function, when it iterates through the
   slots in a node(below tag ascend_to_node), if the slot pointer is meta
   and node->back_pointer != NULL(it means a root), it will proceed to
   descend_to_node. However, there is an exception. If node is the root,
   and one of the slots points to a shortcut, it will be treated as a
   keyring.
2. Whether the ptr is keyring decided by keyring_ptr_is_keyring function.
   However, KEYRING_PTR_SUBTYPE is 0x2UL, the same as
   ASSOC_ARRAY_PTR_SUBTYPE_MASK.
3. When 32 keys with the similar hashes are added to the tree, the ROOT
   has keys with hashes that are not similar (e.g. slot 0) and it splits
   NODE A without using a shortcut. When NODE A is filled with keys that
   all hashes are xxe6, the keys are similar, NODE A will split with a
   shortcut. Finally, it forms the tree as shown below, where slot 6 points
   to a shortcut.

                      NODE A
              +------>+---+
      ROOT    |       | 0 | xxe6
      +---+   |       +---+
 xxxx | 0 | shortcut  :   : xxe6
      +---+   |       +---+
 xxe6 :   :   |       |   | xxe6
      +---+   |       +---+
      | 6 |---+       :   : xxe6
      +---+           +---+
 xxe6 :   :           | f | xxe6
      +---+           +---+
 xxe6 | f |
      +---+

4. As mentioned above, If a slot(slot 6) of the root points to a shortcut,
   it may be mistakenly transferred to a key*, leading to a read
   out-of-bounds read.

To fix this issue, one should jump to descend_to_node if the ptr is a
shortcut, regardless of whether the node is root or not.

So rq_qos_wake_function() calls wake_up_process(data->task), which calls
try_to_wake_up(), which faults in raw_spin_lock_irqsave(&p->pi_lock).

p comes from data->task, and data comes from the waitqueue entry, which
is stored on the waiter's stack in rq_qos_wait(). Analyzing the core
dump with drgn, I found that the waiter had already woken up and moved
on to a completely unrelated code path, clobbering what was previously
data->task. Meanwhile, the waker was passing the clobbered garbage in
data->task to wake_up_process(), leading to the crash.

What's happening is that in between rq_qos_wake_function() deleting the
waitqueue entry and calling wake_up_process(), rq_qos_wait() is finding
that it already got a token and returning. The race looks like this:

rq_qos_wait()                           rq_qos_wake_function()
==============================================================
prepare_to_wait_exclusive()
                                        data->got_token = true;
                                        list_del_init(&curr->entry);
if (data.got_token)
        break;
finish_wait(&rqw->wait, &data.wq);
  ^- returns immediately because
     list_empty_careful(&wq_entry->entry)
     is true
... return, go do something else ...
                                        wake_up_process(data->task)
                                          (NO LONGER VALID!)-^

Normally, finish_wait() is supposed to synchronize against the waker.
But, as noted above, it is returning immediately because the waitqueue
entry has already been removed from the waitqueue.

The bug is that rq_qos_wake_function() is accessing the waitqueue entry
AFTER deleting it. Note that autoremove_wake_function() wakes the waiter
and THEN deletes the waitqueue entry, which is the proper order.

Fix it by swapping the order. We also need to use
list_del_init_careful() to match the list_empty_careful() in
finish_wait().",'-,4.7,6021727,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7293-1),5,5,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 27, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,125231216,ptprt-srv-espap,10.200.1.21,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:24,Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7293-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7293-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT,Group-3",No,No,30,4,"Feb 26, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",Ubuntu,CRITICAL,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 20.04.6,'-,'-,24,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,238,,"#table cols=""3""

KVM: Fix a data race on last_boosted_vcpu in kvm_vcpu_on_spin()

Use {READ,WRITE}_ONCE() to access kvm->last_boosted_vcpu to ensure the
loads and stores are atomic.  In the extremely unlikely scenario the
compiler tears the stores, it's theoretically possible for KVM to attempt
to get a vCPU using an out-of-bounds index, e.g. if the write is split
into multiple 8-bit stores, and is paired with a 32-bit load on a VM with
257 vCPUs:

  CPU0                              CPU1
  last_boosted_vcpu = 0xff;

                                    (last_boosted_vcpu = 0x100)

Most firmware names are hardcoded strings, or are constructed from fairly
constrained format strings where the dynamic parts are just some hex
numbers or such.

However, there are a couple codepaths in the kernel where firmware file
names contain string components that are passed through from a device or
semi-privileged userspace; the ones I could find (not counting interfaces
that require root privileges) are:

 - lpfc_sli4_request_firmware_update() seems to construct the firmware
   filename from ""ModelName"", a string that was previously parsed out of
   some descriptor (""Vital Product Data"") in lpfc_fill_vpd()
 - nfp_net_fw_find() seems to construct a firmware filename from a model
   name coming from nfp_hwinfo_lookup(pf->hwinfo, ""nffw.partno""), which I
   think parses some descriptor that was read from the device.
   (But this case likely isn't exploitable because the format string looks
   like ""netronome/nic_%s"", and there shouldn't be any *folders* starting
   with ""netronome/nic_"". The previous case was different because there,
   the ""%s"" is *at the start* of the format string.)
 - module_flash_fw_schedule() is reachable from the
   ETHTOOL_MSG_MODULE_FW_FLASH_ACT netlink command, which is marked as
   GENL_UNS_ADMIN_PERM (meaning CAP_NET_ADMIN inside a user namespace is
   enough to pass the privilege check), and takes a userspace-provided
   firmware name.
   (But I think to reach this case, you need to have CAP_NET_ADMIN over a
   network namespace that a special kind of ethernet device is mapped into,
   so I think this is not a viable attack path in practice.)

Fix it by rejecting any firmware names containing "".."" path components.

For what it's worth, I went looking and haven't found any USB device
drivers that use the firmware loader dangerously.",'-,7.8,6021727,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7293-1),5,5,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 27, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,125231216,ptprt-srv-espap,10.200.1.21,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:24,Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7293-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7293-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT,Group-3",No,No,35,4,"Feb 26, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",Ubuntu,CRITICAL,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 20.04.6,'-,'-,24,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,238,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-50195,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

posix-clock: Fix missing timespec64 check in pc_clock_settime()

As Andrew pointed out, it will make sense that the PTP core
checked timespec64 struct's tv_sec and tv_nsec range before calling
ptp->info->settime64().

As the man manual of clock_settime() said, if tp.tv_sec is negative or
tp.tv_nsec is outside the range [0..999,999,999], it should return EINVAL,
which include dynamic clocks which handles PTP clock, and the condition is
consistent with timespec64_valid(). As Thomas suggested, timespec64_valid()
only check the timespec is valid, but not ensure that the time is
in a valid range, so check it ahead using timespec64_valid_strict()
in pc_clock_settime() and return -EINVAL if not valid.

There are some drivers that use tp->tv_sec and tp->tv_nsec directly to
write registers without validity checks and assume that the higher layer
has checked it, which is dangerous and will benefit from this, such as
hclge_ptp_settime(), igb_ptp_settime_i210(), _rcar_gen4_ptp_settime(),
and some drivers can remove the checks of itself.",'-,5.5,6021727,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7293-1),5,5,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 27, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,125231216,ptprt-srv-espap,10.200.1.21,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:24,Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7293-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7293-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT,Group-3",No,No,30,4,"Feb 26, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",Ubuntu,CRITICAL,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 20.04.6,'-,'-,24,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,238,,"#table cols=""3""

Syzbot reported that in directory operations after nilfs2 detects
filesystem corruption and degrades to read-only,
__block_write_begin_int(), which is called to prepare block writes, may
fail the BUG_ON check for accesses exceeding the folio/page size,
triggering a kernel bug.

This was found to be because the ""checked"" flag of a page/folio was not
cleared when it was discarded by nilfs2's own routine, which causes the
sanity check of directory entries to be skipped when the directory
page/folio is reloaded.  So, fix that.

CVE-2024-50006,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: fix i_data_sem unlock order in ext4_ind_migrate()

Fuzzing reports a possible deadlock in jbd2_log_wait_commit.

This issue is triggered when an EXT4_IOC_MIGRATE ioctl is set to require
synchronous updates because the file descriptor is opened with O_SYNC.
This can lead to the jbd2_journal_stop() function calling
jbd2_might_wait_for_commit(), potentially causing a deadlock if the
EXT4_IOC_MIGRATE call races with a write(2) system call.

This problem only arises when CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING is enabled. In this
case, the jbd2_might_wait_for_commit macro locks jbd2_handle in the
jbd2_journal_stop function while i_data_sem is locked. This triggers
lockdep because the jbd2_journal_start function might also lock the same
jbd2_handle simultaneously.

Impact summary: A timing side-channel in ECDSA signature computations

CVE-2024-9143,"Issue summary: Use of the low-level GF(2^m) elliptic curve APIs with untrusted
explicit values for the field polynomial can lead to out-of-bounds memory reads
or writes.

Impact summary: Out of bound memory writes can lead to an application crash or
even a possibility of a remote code execution, however, in all the protocols
involving Elliptic Curve Cryptography that we're aware of, either only ""named
curves"" are supported, or, if explicit curve parameters are supported, they
specify an X9.62 encoding of binary (GF(2^m)) curves that can't represent
problematic input values. Thus the likelihood of existence of a vulnerable
application is low.

In particular, the X9.62 encoding is used for ECC keys in X.509 certificates,
so problematic inputs cannot occur in the context of processing X.509
certificates.  Any problematic use-cases would have to be using an ""exotic""
curve encoding.

The affected APIs include: EC_GROUP_new_curve_GF2m(), EC_GROUP_new_from_params(),
and various supporting BN_GF2m_*() functions.

Applications working with ""exotic"" explicit binary (GF(2^m)) curve parameters,
that make it possible to represent invalid field polynomials with a zero
constant term, via the above or similar APIs, may terminate abruptly as a
result of reading or writing outside of array bounds.  Remote code execution
cannot easily be ruled out.

This is because TFM is being used in parallel.

Fix this by allocating a new AEAD TFM for async decryption, but keep
the existing one for synchronous READ cases (similar to what is done

CVE-2024-51744,"golang-jwt is a Go implementation of JSON Web Tokens. Unclear documentation of the error behavior in `ParseWithClaims` can lead to situation where users are potentially not checking errors in the way they should be. Especially, if a token is both expired and invalid, the errors returned by `ParseWithClaims` return both error codes. If users only check for the `jwt.ErrTokenExpired ` using `error.Is`, they will ignore the embedded `jwt.ErrTokenSignatureInvalid` and thus potentially accept invalid tokens. A fix has been back-ported with the error handling logic from the `v5` branch to the `v4` branch. In this logic, the `ParseWithClaims` function will immediately return in ""dangerous"" situations (e.g., an invalid signature), limiting the combined errors only to situations where the signature is valid, but further validation failed (e.g., if the signature is valid, but is expired AND has the wrong audience).

This is because TFM is being used in parallel.

Fix this by allocating a new AEAD TFM for async decryption, but keep
the existing one for synchronous READ cases (similar to what is done
in smb3_calc_signature()).

Also remove the calls to aead_request_set_callback() and
crypto_wait_req() since it's always going to be a synchronous operation.",'-,7.8,358540,Amazon Linux Security Advisory for kernel : ALAS2023-2025-855,4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 24, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,197480041,ptaws-sv-orth01.portugal.pt,"10.64.192.204,172.17.0.1,172.18.0.1","fe80:0:0:0:42:4bff:fe14:b556,fe80:0:0:0:8a7:e2ff:fe53:ac31,fe80:0:0:0:7072:edff:fefc:3bfa","Please refer to Amazon advisory: ALAS2023-2025-855 for affected packages and patching details, or update with your package manager.(https://alas.aws.amazon.com/AL2023/ALAS-2025-855.html)","PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,35,6,"Feb 24, 2025","Feb 12, 2025",Amazon Linux,HIGH,High Lateral Movement,Amazon Linux 2023.6.20250211,'-,'-,37,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a securitybreach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,13,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-41066,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ibmvnic: Add tx check to prevent skb leak

Below is a summary of how the driver stores a reference to an skb during
transmit:
    tx_buff[free_map[consumer_index]]->skb = new_skb;
    free_map[consumer_index] = IBMVNIC_INVALID_MAP;
    consumer_index ++;
Where variable data looks like this:
    free_map == [4, IBMVNIC_INVALID_MAP, IBMVNIC_INVALID_MAP, 0, 3]
                                               	consumer_index^
    tx_buff == [skb=null, skb=<ptr>, skb=<ptr>, skb=null, skb=null]

The driver has checks to ensure that free_map[consumer_index] pointed to
a valid index but there was no check to ensure that this index pointed
to an unused/null skb address. So, if, by some chance, our free_map and
tx_buff lists become out of sync then we were previously risking an
skb memory leak. This could then cause tcp congestion control to stop
sending packets, eventually leading to ETIMEDOUT.

Therefore, add a conditional to ensure that the skb address is null. If
not then warn the user (because this is still a bug that should be
patched) and free the old pointer to prevent memleak/tcp problems.",'-,5.5,6021727,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7293-1),5,5,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 27, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,176482162,PTDTC-SV-TOOLS.portugal.pt,"10.1.1.246,10.88.0.246","fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:970,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:4a42",Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7293-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7293-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,30,4,"Feb 26, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",Ubuntu,CRITICAL,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 20.04.6,'-,'-,24,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,237,,"#table cols=""3""

RDMA/iwcm: Fix WARNING:at_kernel/workqueue.c:#check_flush_dependency

In the commit aee2424246f9 (""RDMA/iwcm: Fix a use-after-free related to
destroying CM IDs""), the function flush_workqueue is invoked to flush the
work queue iwcm_wq.

But at that time, the work queue iwcm_wq was created via the function
alloc_ordered_workqueue without the flag WQ_MEM_RECLAIM.

Because the current process is trying to flush the whole iwcm_wq, if
iwcm_wq doesn't have the flag WQ_MEM_RECLAIM, verify that the current
process is not reclaiming memory or running on a workqueue which doesn't
have the flag WQ_MEM_RECLAIM as that can break forward-progress guarantee
leading to a deadlock.

CVE-2024-49867,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: wait for fixup workers before stopping cleaner kthread during umount

During unmount, at close_ctree(), we have the following steps in this order:

1) Park the cleaner kthread - this doesn't destroy the kthread, it basically
   halts its execution (wake ups against it work but do nothing);

2) We stop the cleaner kthread - this results in freeing the respective
   struct task_struct;

3) We call btrfs_stop_all_workers() which waits for any jobs running in all
   the work queues and then free the work queues.

Syzbot reported a case where a fixup worker resulted in a crash when doing
a delayed iput on its inode while attempting to wake up the cleaner at
btrfs_add_delayed_iput(), because the task_struct of the cleaner kthread
was already freed. This can happen during unmount because we don't wait
for any fixup workers still running before we call kthread_stop() against
the cleaner kthread, which stops and free all its resources.

Fix this by waiting for any fixup workers at close_ctree() before we call
kthread_stop() against the cleaner and run pending delayed iputs.

The stack traces reported by syzbot were the following:

[CAUSE]
The allocation failure happens at the start_transaction() inside
prepare_to_relocate(), and during the error handling we call
unset_reloc_control(), which makes fs_info->balance_ctl to be NULL.

Then we continue the error path cleanup in btrfs_balance() by calling
reset_balance_state() which will call del_balance_item() to fully delete
the balance item in the root tree.

However during the small window between set_reloc_contrl() and
unset_reloc_control(), we can have a subvolume tree update and created a
reloc_root for that subvolume.

Then we go into the final btrfs_commit_transaction() of
del_balance_item(), and into btrfs_update_reloc_root() inside
commit_fs_roots().

That function checks if fs_info->reloc_ctl is in the merge_reloc_tree
stage, but since fs_info->reloc_ctl is NULL, it results a NULL pointer
dereference.

[FIX]
Just add extra check on fs_info->reloc_ctl inside
btrfs_update_reloc_root(), before checking
fs_info->reloc_ctl->merge_reloc_tree.

That DEAD_RELOC_TREE handling is to prevent further modification to the
reloc tree during merge stage, but since there is no reloc_ctl at all,
we do not need to bother that.",'-,5.5,6021727,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7293-1),5,5,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 27, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,176482162,PTDTC-SV-TOOLS.portugal.pt,"10.1.1.246,10.88.0.246","fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:970,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:4a42",Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7293-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7293-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,30,4,"Feb 26, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",Ubuntu,CRITICAL,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 20.04.6,'-,'-,24,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,237,,"#table cols=""3""

media: dvbdev: prevent the risk of out of memory access

The dvbdev contains a static variable used to store dvb minors.

The behavior of it depends if CONFIG_DVB_DYNAMIC_MINORS is set
or not. When not set, dvb_register_device() won't check for
boundaries, as it will rely that a previous call to
dvb_register_adapter() would already be enforcing it.

On a similar way, dvb_device_open() uses the assumption
that the register functions already did the needed checks.

calls. This also generate warnings on static check analysers

CVE-2024-50194,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64: probes: Fix uprobes for big-endian kernels

The arm64 uprobes code is broken for big-endian kernels as it doesn't
convert the in-memory instruction encoding (which is always
little-endian) into the kernel's native endianness before analyzing and
simulating instructions. This may result in a few distinct problems:

* The kernel may may erroneously reject probing an instruction which can
  safely be probed.

* The kernel may erroneously erroneously permit stepping an
  instruction out-of-line when that instruction cannot be stepped
  out-of-line safely.

* The kernel may erroneously simulate instruction incorrectly dur to
  interpretting the byte-swapped encoding.

The endianness mismatch isn't caught by the compiler or sparse because:

* The arch_uprobe::{insn,ixol} fields are encoded as arrays of u8, so
  the compiler and sparse have no idea these contain a little-endian
  32-bit value. The core uprobes code populates these with a memcpy()
  which similarly does not handle endianness.

* While the uprobe_opcode_t type is an alias for __le32, both
  arch_uprobe_analyze_insn() and arch_uprobe_skip_sstep() cast from u8[]
  to the similarly-named probe_opcode_t, which is an alias for u32.
  Hence there is no endianness conversion warning.

Fix this by changing the arch_uprobe::{insn,ixol} fields to __le32 and
adding the appropriate __le32_to_cpu() conversions prior to consuming
the instruction encoding. The core uprobes copies these fields as opaque
ranges of bytes, and so is unaffected by this change.

At the same time, remove MAX_UINSN_BYTES and consistently use
AARCH64_INSN_SIZE for clarity.

CVE-2024-47740,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

f2fs: Require FMODE_WRITE for atomic write ioctls

The F2FS ioctls for starting and committing atomic writes check for
inode_owner_or_capable(), but this does not give LSMs like SELinux or
Landlock an opportunity to deny the write access - if the caller's FSUID
matches the inode's UID, inode_owner_or_capable() immediately returns true.

There are scenarios where LSMs want to deny a process the ability to write
particular files, even files that the FSUID of the process owns; but this
can currently partially be bypassed using atomic write ioctls in two ways:

 - F2FS_IOC_START_ATOMIC_REPLACE + F2FS_IOC_COMMIT_ATOMIC_WRITE can
   truncate an inode to size 0
 - F2FS_IOC_START_ATOMIC_WRITE + F2FS_IOC_ABORT_ATOMIC_WRITE can revert
   changes another process concurrently made to a file

Fix it by requiring FMODE_WRITE for these operations, just like for

ioctls when intending to write into the file, that seems unlikely to break

nilfs2: fix potential null-ptr-deref in nilfs_btree_insert()

Patch series ""nilfs2: fix potential issues with empty b-tree nodes"".

This series addresses three potential issues with empty b-tree nodes that
can occur with corrupted filesystem images, including one recently
discovered by syzbot.


This patch (of 3):

If a b-tree is broken on the device, and the b-tree height is greater than
2 (the level of the root node is greater than 1) even if the number of
child nodes of the b-tree root is 0, a NULL pointer dereference occurs in
nilfs_btree_prepare_insert(), which is called from nilfs_btree_insert().

This is because, when the number of child nodes of the b-tree root is 0,
nilfs_btree_do_lookup() does not set the block buffer head in any of
path[x].bp_bh, leaving it as the initial value of NULL, but if the level
of the b-tree root node is greater than 1, nilfs_btree_get_nonroot_node(),
which accesses the buffer memory of path[x].bp_bh, is called.

Fix this issue by adding a check to nilfs_btree_root_broken(), which
performs sanity checks when reading the root node from the device, to
detect this inconsistency.

CVE-2024-49878,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

resource: fix region_intersects() vs add_memory_driver_managed()

On a system with CXL memory, the resource tree (/proc/iomem) related to
CXL memory may look like something as follows.

490000000-50fffffff : CXL Window 0
  490000000-50fffffff : region0
    490000000-50fffffff : dax0.0
      490000000-50fffffff : System RAM (kmem)

Because drivers/dax/kmem.c calls add_memory_driver_managed() during
onlining CXL memory, which makes ""System RAM (kmem)"" a descendant of ""CXL
Window X"".  This confuses region_intersects(), which expects all ""System
RAM"" resources to be at the top level of iomem_resource.  This can lead to
bugs.

For example, when the following command line is executed to write some
memory in CXL memory range via /dev/mem,

 $ dd if=data of=/dev/mem bs=$((1 << 10)) seek=$((0x490000000 >> 10)) count=1
 dd: error writing '/dev/mem': Bad address
 1+0 records in
 0+0 records out
 0 bytes copied, 0.0283507 s, 0.0 kB/s

the command fails as expected.  However, the error code is wrong.  It
should be ""Operation not permitted"" instead of ""Bad address"".  More
seriously, the /dev/mem permission checking in devmem_is_allowed() passes
incorrectly.  Although the accessing is prevented later because ioremap()
isn't allowed to map system RAM, it is a potential security issue.  During
command executing, the following warning is reported in the kernel log for
calling ioremap() on system RAM.

 ioremap on RAM at 0x0000000490000000 - 0x0000000490000fff
 WARNING: CPU: 2 PID: 416 at arch/x86/mm/ioremap.c:216 __ioremap_caller.constprop.0+0x131/0x35d

  entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x4b/0x53

The details of command execution process are as follows.  In the above
resource tree, ""System RAM"" is a descendant of ""CXL Window 0"" instead of a
top level resource.  So, region_intersects() will report no System RAM
resources in the CXL memory region incorrectly, because it only checks the
top level resources.  Consequently, devmem_is_allowed() will return 1
(allow access via /dev/mem) for CXL memory region incorrectly. 
Fortunately, ioremap() doesn't allow to map System RAM and reject the
access.

So, region_intersects() needs to be fixed to work correctly with the
resource tree with ""System RAM"" not at top level as above.  To fix it, if
we found a unmatched resource in the top level, we will continue to search
matched resources in its descendant resources.  So, we will not miss any
matched resources in resource tree anymore.

In the new implementation, an example resource tree

|------------- ""CXL Window 0"" ------------|
|-- ""System RAM"" --|

will behave similar as the following fake resource tree for
region_intersects(, IORESOURCE_SYSTEM_RAM, ),

|-- ""System RAM"" --||-- ""CXL Window 0a"" --|

Where ""CXL Window 0a"" is part of the original ""CXL Window 0"" that
isn't covered by ""System RAM"".",'-,5.5,6021727,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7293-1),5,5,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 27, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,176482162,PTDTC-SV-TOOLS.portugal.pt,"10.1.1.246,10.88.0.246","fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:970,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:4a42",Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7293-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7293-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,30,4,"Feb 26, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",Ubuntu,CRITICAL,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 20.04.6,'-,'-,24,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,237,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-50229,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nilfs2: fix potential deadlock with newly created symlinks

Syzbot reported that page_symlink(), called by nilfs_symlink(), triggers
memory reclamation involving the filesystem layer, which can result in
circular lock dependencies among the reader/writer semaphore
nilfs->ns_segctor_sem, s_writers percpu_rwsem (intwrite) and the
fs_reclaim pseudo lock.

This is because after commit 21fc61c73c39 (""don't put symlink bodies in
pagecache into highmem""), the gfp flags of the page cache for symbolic
links are overwritten to GFP_KERNEL via inode_nohighmem().

This is not a problem for symlinks read from the backing device, because
the __GFP_FS flag is dropped after inode_nohighmem() is called.  However,
when a new symlink is created with nilfs_symlink(), the gfp flags remain
overwritten to GFP_KERNEL.  Then, memory allocation called from
page_symlink() etc.  triggers memory reclamation including the FS layer,
which may call nilfs_evict_inode() or nilfs_dirty_inode().  And these can
cause a deadlock if they are called while nilfs->ns_segctor_sem is held:

Fix this issue by dropping the __GFP_FS flag from the page cache GFP flags
of newly created symlinks in the same way that nilfs_new_inode() and
__nilfs_read_inode() do, as a workaround until we adopt nofs allocation
scope consistently or improve the locking constraints.",'-,5.5,6021727,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7293-1),5,5,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 27, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,176482162,PTDTC-SV-TOOLS.portugal.pt,"10.1.1.246,10.88.0.246","fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:970,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:4a42",Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7293-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7293-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,30,4,"Feb 26, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",Ubuntu,CRITICAL,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 20.04.6,'-,'-,24,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,237,,"#table cols=""3""

drm/vmwgfx: Fix a deadlock in dma buf fence polling

Introduce a version of the fence ops that on release doesn't remove
the fence from the pending list, and thus doesn't require a lock to
fix poll->fence wait->fence unref deadlocks.

vmwgfx overwrites the wait callback to iterate over the list of all
fences and update their status, to do that it holds a lock to prevent
the list modifcations from other threads. The fence destroy callback
both deletes the fence and removes it from the list of pending
fences, for which it holds a lock.

dma buf polling cb unrefs a fence after it's been signaled: so the poll
calls the wait, which signals the fences, which are being destroyed.
The destruction tries to acquire the lock on the pending fences list
which it can never get because it's held by the wait from which it
was called.

There is a WARNING in iwl_trans_wait_tx_queues_empty() (that was

wait for TX queues to become empty after firmware died. Clearly,
we can't expect anything from the firmware after it's declared dead.

be a good idea to stop the flow earlier, the flush functions do some
maintenance work that is not related to the firmware, so keep that part

mm: avoid leaving partial pfn mappings around in error case

As Jann points out, PFN mappings are special, because unlike normal
memory mappings, there is no lifetime information associated with the
mapping - it is just a raw mapping of PFNs with no reference counting of
a 'struct page'.

That's all very much intentional, but it does mean that it's easy to
mess up the cleanup in case of errors.  Yes, a failed mmap() will always
eventually clean up any partial mappings, but without any explicit
lifetime in the page table mapping itself, it's very easy to do the
error handling in the wrong order.

In particular, it's easy to mistakenly free the physical backing store
before the page tables are actually cleaned up and (temporarily) have
stale dangling PTE entries.

To make this situation less error-prone, just make sure that any partial
pfn mapping is torn down early, before any other error handling.",'-,5.5,6021727,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7293-1),5,5,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 27, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,176482162,PTDTC-SV-TOOLS.portugal.pt,"10.1.1.246,10.88.0.246","fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:970,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:4a42",Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7293-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7293-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,37,4,"Feb 26, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",Ubuntu,CRITICAL,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 20.04.6,'-,'-,24,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,237,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-50039,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/sched: accept TCA_STAB only for root qdisc

Most qdiscs maintain their backlog using qdisc_pkt_len(skb)
on the assumption it is invariant between the enqueue()
and dequeue() handlers.

Unfortunately syzbot can crash a host rather easily using
a TBF + SFQ combination, with an STAB on SFQ [1]

We can't support TCA_STAB on arbitrary level, this would
require to maintain per-qdisc storage.

CVE-2024-47706,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

block, bfq: fix possible UAF for bfqq->bic with merge chain

1) initial state, three tasks:

		  |  ?            |  ?		  |  ?

		  bfqq1           bfqq2		  bfqq3
process ref:	   1		    1		    1

2) bfqq1 merged to bfqq2:

		Process 1       Process 2	Process 3
		 (BIC1)          (BIC2)		 (BIC3)
		  |               |		  |  ?

3) bfqq2 merged to bfqq3:

		  bfqq1--------->bfqq2---------->bfqq3

In this case, IO from Process 1 will get bfqq2 from BIC1 first, and then
get bfqq3 through merge chain, and finially handle IO by bfqq3.
Howerver, current code will think bfqq2 is owned by BIC1, like initial
state, and set bfqq2->bic to BIC1.

 rq->elv.priv[0] = bic
 rq->elv.priv[1] = bfqq
 if (bfqq_process_refs(bfqq) == 1)
  bfqq->bic = bic

CVE-2024-50278,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dm cache: fix potential out-of-bounds access on the first resume

Out-of-bounds access occurs if the fast device is expanded unexpectedly
before the first-time resume of the cache table. This happens because
expanding the fast device requires reloading the cache table for
cache_create to allocate new in-core data structures that fit the new
size, and the check in cache_preresume is not performed during the
first resume, leading to the issue.

Reproduce steps:

1. prepare component devices:

dmsetup create cmeta --table ""0 8192 linear /dev/sdc 0""
dmsetup create cdata --table ""0 65536 linear /dev/sdc 8192""
dmsetup create corig --table ""0 524288 linear /dev/sdc 262144""
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/mapper/cmeta bs=4k count=1 oflag=direct

2. load a cache table of 512 cache blocks, and deliberately expand the
   fast device before resuming the cache, making the in-core data
   structures inadequate.

dmsetup create cache --notable
dmsetup reload cache --table ""0 524288 cache /dev/mapper/cmeta \
/dev/mapper/cdata /dev/mapper/corig 128 2 metadata2 writethrough smq 0""
dmsetup reload cdata --table ""0 131072 linear /dev/sdc 8192""
dmsetup resume cdata
dmsetup resume cache

3. suspend the cache to write out the in-core dirty bitset and hint
   array, leading to out-of-bounds access to the dirty bitset at offset
   0x40:

dmsetup suspend cache

CVE-2024-47709,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

can: bcm: Clear bo->bcm_proc_read after remove_proc_entry().

syzbot reported a warning in bcm_release(). [0]

The blamed change fixed another warning that is triggered when
connect() is issued again for a socket whose connect()ed device has
been unregistered.

However, if the socket is just close()d without the 2nd connect(), the
remaining bo->bcm_proc_read triggers unnecessary remove_proc_entry()
in bcm_release().

Let's clear bo->bcm_proc_read after remove_proc_entry() in bcm_notify().

CVE-2024-50151,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

smb: client: fix OOBs when building SMB2_IOCTL request

When using encryption, either enforced by the server or when using
'seal' mount option, the client will squash all compound request buffers
down for encryption into a single iov in smb2_set_next_command().

SMB2_ioctl_init() allocates a small buffer (448 bytes) to hold the
SMB2_IOCTL request in the first iov, and if the user passes an input
buffer that is greater than 328 bytes, smb2_set_next_command() will
end up writing off the end of @rqst->iov[0].iov_base as shown below:

CVE-2024-50273,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: reinitialize delayed ref list after deleting it from the list

At insert_delayed_ref() if we need to update the action of an existing
ref to BTRFS_DROP_DELAYED_REF, we delete the ref from its ref head's
ref_add_list using list_del(), which leaves the ref's add_list member
not reinitialized, as list_del() sets the next and prev members of the
list to LIST_POISON1 and LIST_POISON2, respectively.

If later we end up calling drop_delayed_ref() against the ref, which can
happen during merging or when destroying delayed refs due to a transaction
abort, we can trigger a crash since at drop_delayed_ref() we call
list_empty() against the ref's add_list, which returns false since
the list was not reinitialized after the list_del() and as a consequence
we call list_del() again at drop_delayed_ref(). This results in an
invalid list access since the next and prev members are set to poison
pointers, resulting in a splat if CONFIG_LIST_HARDENED and
CONFIG_DEBUG_LIST are set or invalid poison pointer dereferences
otherwise.

So fix this by deleting from the list with list_del_init() instead.",'-,5.5,6021727,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7293-1),5,5,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 27, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,176482162,PTDTC-SV-TOOLS.portugal.pt,"10.1.1.246,10.88.0.246","fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:970,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:4a42",Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7293-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7293-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,'-,4,"Feb 26, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",Ubuntu,CRITICAL,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 20.04.6,'-,'-,24,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,237,,"#table cols=""3""

slip: make slhc_remember() more robust against malicious packets

syzbot found that slhc_remember() was missing checks against
malicious packets [1].

slhc_remember() only checked the size of the packet was at least 20,

We need to make sure the packet includes the IPv4 and TCP header

Add iph and th pointers to make the code more readable.

CVE-2024-49985,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

i2c: stm32f7: Do not prepare/unprepare clock during runtime suspend/resume

In case there is any sort of clock controller attached to this I2C bus
controller, for example Versaclock or even an AIC32x4 I2C codec, then
an I2C transfer triggered from the clock controller clk_ops .prepare
callback may trigger a deadlock on drivers/clk/clk.c prepare_lock mutex.

This is because the clock controller first grabs the prepare_lock mutex
and then performs the prepare operation, including its I2C access. The
I2C access resumes this I2C bus controller via .runtime_resume callback,
which calls clk_prepare_enable(), which attempts to grab the prepare_lock
mutex again and deadlocks.

Since the clock are already prepared since probe() and unprepared in
remove(), use simple clk_enable()/clk_disable() calls to enable and
disable the clock on runtime suspend and resume, to avoid hitting the
prepare_lock mutex.",'-,5.5,6021727,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7293-1),5,5,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 27, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,176482162,PTDTC-SV-TOOLS.portugal.pt,"10.1.1.246,10.88.0.246","fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:970,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:4a42",Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7293-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7293-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,30,4,"Feb 26, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",Ubuntu,CRITICAL,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 20.04.6,'-,'-,24,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,237,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-49982,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

aoe: fix the potential use-after-free problem in more places

For fixing CVE-2023-6270, f98364e92662 (""aoe: fix the potential
use-after-free problem in aoecmd_cfg_pkts"") makes tx() calling dev_put()
instead of doing in aoecmd_cfg_pkts(). It avoids that the tx() runs
into use-after-free.

Then Nicolai Stange found more places in aoe have potential use-after-free
problem with tx(). e.g. revalidate(), aoecmd_ata_rw(), resend(), probe()
and aoecmd_cfg_rsp(). Those functions also use aoenet_xmit() to push
packet to tx queue. So they should also use dev_hold() to increase the
refcnt of skb->dev.

On the other hand, moving dev_put() to tx() causes that the refcnt of
skb->dev be reduced to a negative value, because corresponding
dev_hold() are not called in revalidate(), aoecmd_ata_rw(), resend(),
probe(), and aoecmd_cfg_rsp().

In the `wilc_parse_join_bss_param` function, the TSF field of the `ies`
structure is accessed after the RCU read-side critical section is
unlocked. According to RCU usage rules, this is illegal. Reusing this
pointer can lead to unpredictable behavior, including accessing memory

This possible bug was identified using a static analysis tool developed
by myself, specifically designed to detect RCU-related issues.

vfs: fix race between evice_inodes() and find_inode()&iput()

Hi, all

Recently I noticed a bug[1] in btrfs, after digged it into
and I believe it'a race in vfs.

Let's assume there's a inode (ie ino 261) with i_count 1 is
called by iput(), and there's a concurrent thread calling
generic_shutdown_super().

cpu0:                              cpu1:
iput() // i_count is 1
  ->spin_lock(inode)
  ->dec i_count to 0
  ->iput_final()                    generic_shutdown_super()
    ->__inode_add_lru()               ->evict_inodes()
      // cause some reason[2]           ->if (atomic_read(inode->i_count)) continue;
      // return before                  // inode 261 passed the above check
      // list_lru_add_obj()             // and then schedule out
   ->spin_unlock()
// note here: the inode 261
// was still at sb list and hash list,
// and I_FREEING|I_WILL_FREE was not been set

btrfs_iget()
  // after some function calls
  ->find_inode()
    // found the above inode 261
    ->spin_lock(inode)
   // check I_FREEING|I_WILL_FREE

  // dec i_count to 0
  ->iput_final()
    ->spin_unlock()
    ->evict()

Now, we have two threads simultaneously evicting
the same inode, which may trigger the BUG(inode->i_state & I_CLEAR)
statement both within clear_inode() and iput().

To fix the bug, recheck the inode->i_count after holding i_lock.
Because in the most scenarios, the first check is valid, and
the overhead of spin_lock() can be reduced.

If there is any misunderstanding, please let me know, thanks.

CVE-2024-50045,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: br_netfilter: fix panic with metadata_dst skb

Fix a kernel panic in the br_netfilter module when sending untagged
traffic via a VxLAN device.
This happens during the check for fragmentation in br_nf_dev_queue_xmit.

It is dependent on:
1) the br_netfilter module being loaded;
2) net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables set to 1;
3) a bridge with a VxLAN (single-vxlan-device) netdevice as a bridge port;
4) untagged frames with size higher than the VxLAN MTU forwarded/flooded

When forwarding the untagged packet to the VxLAN bridge port, before
the netfilter hooks are called, br_handle_egress_vlan_tunnel is called and
changes the skb_dst to the tunnel dst. The tunnel_dst is a metadata type
of dst, i.e., skb_valid_dst(skb) is false, and metadata->dst.dev is NULL.

Then in the br_netfilter hooks, in br_nf_dev_queue_xmit, there's a check
for frames that needs to be fragmented: frames with higher MTU than the
VxLAN device end up calling br_nf_ip_fragment, which in turns call
ip_skb_dst_mtu.

The ip_dst_mtu tries to use the skb_dst(skb) as if it was a valid dst
with valid dst->dev, thus the crash.

This case was never supported in the first place, so drop the packet
instead.

nilfs2: propagate directory read errors from nilfs_find_entry()

Syzbot reported that a task hang occurs in vcs_open() during a fuzzing

The root cause of this problem is that in nilfs_find_entry(), which
searches for directory entries, ignores errors when loading a directory
page/folio via nilfs_get_folio() fails.

If the filesystem images is corrupted, and the i_size of the directory
inode is large, and the directory page/folio is successfully read but
fails the sanity check, for example when it is zero-filled,
nilfs_check_folio() may continue to spit out error messages in bursts.

Fix this issue by propagating the error to the callers when loading a
page/folio fails in nilfs_find_entry().

be dereferenced as sk_state is LISTENING, which causes a crash as bind_hash

CVE-2024-49949,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: avoid potential underflow in qdisc_pkt_len_init() with UFO

After commit 7c6d2ecbda83 (""net: be more gentle about silly gso
requests coming from user"") virtio_net_hdr_to_skb() had sanity check
to detect malicious attempts from user space to cook a bad GSO packet.

Then commit cf9acc90c80ec (""net: virtio_net_hdr_to_skb: count
transport header in UFO"") while fixing one issue, allowed user space
to cook a GSO packet with the following characteristic :

IPv4 SKB_GSO_UDP, gso_size=3, skb->len = 28.

When this packet arrives in qdisc_pkt_len_init(), we end up
with hdr_len = 28 (IPv4 header + UDP header), matching skb->len

Then the following sets gso_segs to 0 :

gso_segs = DIV_ROUND_UP(skb->len - hdr_len,
                        shinfo->gso_size);

Then later we set qdisc_skb_cb(skb)->pkt_len to back to zero :/

qdisc_skb_cb(skb)->pkt_len += (gso_segs - 1) * hdr_len;

This leads to the following crash in fq_codel [1]

qdisc_pkt_len_init() is best effort, we only want an estimation
of the bytes sent on the wire, not crashing the kernel.

This patch is fixing this particular issue, a following one
adds more sanity checks for another potential bug.

gpio: prevent potential speculation leaks in gpio_device_get_desc()

Userspace may trigger a speculative read of an address outside the gpio
descriptor array.
Users can do that by calling gpio_ioctl() with an offset out of range.
Offset is copied from user and then used as an array index to get
the gpio descriptor without sanitization in gpio_device_get_desc().

This change ensures that the offset is sanitized by using
array_index_nospec() to mitigate any possibility of speculative
information leaks.

`nouveau_dmem_copy_one` will likely report success, leading to the

CVE-2024-50099,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64: probes: Remove broken LDR (literal) uprobe support

The simulate_ldr_literal() and simulate_ldrsw_literal() functions are
unsafe to use for uprobes. Both functions were originally written for
use with kprobes, and access memory with plain C accesses. When uprobes
was added, these were reused unmodified even though they cannot safely
access user memory.

There are three key problems:

1) The plain C accesses do not have corresponding extable entries, and
   thus if they encounter a fault the kernel will treat these as
   unintentional accesses to user memory, resulting in a BUG() which
   will kill the kernel thread, and likely lead to further issues (e.g.
   lockup or panic()).

2) The plain C accesses are subject to HW PAN and SW PAN, and so when
   either is in use, any attempt to simulate an access to user memory
   will fault. Thus neither simulate_ldr_literal() nor
   simulate_ldrsw_literal() can do anything useful when simulating a
   user instruction on any system with HW PAN or SW PAN.

3) The plain C accesses are privileged, as they run in kernel context,
   and in practice can access a small range of kernel virtual addresses.
   The instructions they simulate have a range of +/-1MiB, and since the
   simulated instructions must itself be a user instructions in the
   TTBR0 address range, these can address the final 1MiB of the TTBR1
   acddress range by wrapping downwards from an address in the first
   1MiB of the TTBR0 address range.

   In contemporary kernels the last 8MiB of TTBR1 address range is
   reserved, and accesses to this will always fault, meaning this is no
   worse than (1).

   Historically, it was theoretically possible for the linear map or
   vmemmap to spill into the final 8MiB of the TTBR1 address range, but
   in practice this is extremely unlikely to occur as this would
   require either:

   * Having enough physical memory to fill the entire linear map all the
     way to the final 1MiB of the TTBR1 address range.

   * Getting unlucky with KASLR randomization of the linear map such
     that the populated region happens to overlap with the last 1MiB of
     the TTBR address range.

   ... and in either case if we were to spill into the final page there
   would be larger problems as the final page would alias with error
   pointers.

Practically speaking, (1) and (2) are the big issues. Given there have
been no reports of problems since the broken code was introduced, it
appears that no-one is relying on probing these instructions with
uprobes.

Avoid these issues by not allowing uprobes on LDR (literal) and LDRSW
(literal), limiting the use of simulate_ldr_literal() and
simulate_ldrsw_literal() to kprobes. Attempts to place uprobes on LDR
(literal) and LDRSW (literal) will be rejected as
arm_probe_decode_insn() will return INSN_REJECTED. In future we can
consider introducing working uprobes support for these instructions, but
this will require more significant work.",'-,5.5,6021727,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7293-1),5,5,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 27, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,176482162,PTDTC-SV-TOOLS.portugal.pt,"10.1.1.246,10.88.0.246","fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:970,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:4a42",Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7293-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7293-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,30,4,"Feb 26, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",Ubuntu,CRITICAL,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 20.04.6,'-,'-,24,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,237,,"#table cols=""3""

call battery_hook_unregister() on the already unregistered battery
hook, resulting in a crash.

The issue was in the reflink workfow while reserving space for inline
xattr.  The problematic function is ocfs2_reflink_xattr_inline().  By the
time this function is called the reflink tree is already recreated at the
destination inode from the source inode.  At this point, this function
reserves space for inline xattrs at the destination inode without even
checking if there is space at the root metadata block.  It simply reduces
the l_count from 243 to 227 thereby making space of 256 bytes for inline
xattr whereas the inode already has extents beyond this index (in this
case up to 230), thereby causing corruption.

The fix for this is to reserve space for inline metadata at the destination
inode before the reflink tree gets recreated. The customer has verified the
fix.",'-,5.5,6021727,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7293-1),5,5,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 27, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,176482162,PTDTC-SV-TOOLS.portugal.pt,"10.1.1.246,10.88.0.246","fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:970,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:4a42",Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7293-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7293-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,30,4,"Feb 26, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",Ubuntu,CRITICAL,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 20.04.6,'-,'-,24,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,237,,"#table cols=""3""

Reproducer uses faultinject facility to fail ocfs2_xa_remove() ->
ocfs2_xa_value_truncate() with -ENOMEM.

In this case the comment mentions that we can return 0 if
ocfs2_xa_cleanup_value_truncate() is going to wipe the entry
anyway. But the following 'rc' check is wrong and execution flow do
'ocfs2_xa_remove_entry(loc);' twice:
* 1st: in ocfs2_xa_cleanup_value_truncate();
* 2nd: returning back to ocfs2_xa_remove() instead of going to 'out'.

Fix this by skipping the 2nd removal of the same entry and making

This issue was also reported by syzbot.

It can be reproduced by following these steps(more details [1]):
1. Obtain more than 32 inputs that have similar hashes, which ends with the
   pattern '0xxxxxxxe6'.
2. Reboot and add the keys obtained in step 1.

The reproducer demonstrates how this issue happened:
1. In the search_nested_keyrings function, when it iterates through the
   slots in a node(below tag ascend_to_node), if the slot pointer is meta
   and node->back_pointer != NULL(it means a root), it will proceed to
   descend_to_node. However, there is an exception. If node is the root,
   and one of the slots points to a shortcut, it will be treated as a
   keyring.
2. Whether the ptr is keyring decided by keyring_ptr_is_keyring function.
   However, KEYRING_PTR_SUBTYPE is 0x2UL, the same as
   ASSOC_ARRAY_PTR_SUBTYPE_MASK.
3. When 32 keys with the similar hashes are added to the tree, the ROOT
   has keys with hashes that are not similar (e.g. slot 0) and it splits
   NODE A without using a shortcut. When NODE A is filled with keys that
   all hashes are xxe6, the keys are similar, NODE A will split with a
   shortcut. Finally, it forms the tree as shown below, where slot 6 points
   to a shortcut.

                      NODE A
              +------>+---+
      ROOT    |       | 0 | xxe6
      +---+   |       +---+
 xxxx | 0 | shortcut  :   : xxe6
      +---+   |       +---+
 xxe6 :   :   |       |   | xxe6
      +---+   |       +---+
      | 6 |---+       :   : xxe6
      +---+           +---+
 xxe6 :   :           | f | xxe6
      +---+           +---+
 xxe6 | f |
      +---+

4. As mentioned above, If a slot(slot 6) of the root points to a shortcut,
   it may be mistakenly transferred to a key*, leading to a read
   out-of-bounds read.

To fix this issue, one should jump to descend_to_node if the ptr is a
shortcut, regardless of whether the node is root or not.

So rq_qos_wake_function() calls wake_up_process(data->task), which calls
try_to_wake_up(), which faults in raw_spin_lock_irqsave(&p->pi_lock).

p comes from data->task, and data comes from the waitqueue entry, which
is stored on the waiter's stack in rq_qos_wait(). Analyzing the core
dump with drgn, I found that the waiter had already woken up and moved
on to a completely unrelated code path, clobbering what was previously
data->task. Meanwhile, the waker was passing the clobbered garbage in
data->task to wake_up_process(), leading to the crash.

What's happening is that in between rq_qos_wake_function() deleting the
waitqueue entry and calling wake_up_process(), rq_qos_wait() is finding
that it already got a token and returning. The race looks like this:

rq_qos_wait()                           rq_qos_wake_function()
==============================================================
prepare_to_wait_exclusive()
                                        data->got_token = true;
                                        list_del_init(&curr->entry);
if (data.got_token)
        break;
finish_wait(&rqw->wait, &data.wq);
  ^- returns immediately because
     list_empty_careful(&wq_entry->entry)
     is true
... return, go do something else ...
                                        wake_up_process(data->task)
                                          (NO LONGER VALID!)-^

Normally, finish_wait() is supposed to synchronize against the waker.
But, as noted above, it is returning immediately because the waitqueue
entry has already been removed from the waitqueue.

The bug is that rq_qos_wake_function() is accessing the waitqueue entry
AFTER deleting it. Note that autoremove_wake_function() wakes the waiter
and THEN deletes the waitqueue entry, which is the proper order.

Fix it by swapping the order. We also need to use
list_del_init_careful() to match the list_empty_careful() in
finish_wait().",'-,4.7,6021727,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7293-1),5,5,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 27, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,176482162,PTDTC-SV-TOOLS.portugal.pt,"10.1.1.246,10.88.0.246","fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:970,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:4a42",Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7293-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7293-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,30,4,"Feb 26, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",Ubuntu,CRITICAL,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 20.04.6,'-,'-,24,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,237,,"#table cols=""3""

KVM: Fix a data race on last_boosted_vcpu in kvm_vcpu_on_spin()

Use {READ,WRITE}_ONCE() to access kvm->last_boosted_vcpu to ensure the
loads and stores are atomic.  In the extremely unlikely scenario the
compiler tears the stores, it's theoretically possible for KVM to attempt
to get a vCPU using an out-of-bounds index, e.g. if the write is split
into multiple 8-bit stores, and is paired with a 32-bit load on a VM with
257 vCPUs:

  CPU0                              CPU1
  last_boosted_vcpu = 0xff;

                                    (last_boosted_vcpu = 0x100)
                                    last_boosted_vcpu[15:8] = 0x01;
  i = (last_boosted_vcpu = 0x1ff)
                                    last_boosted_vcpu[7:0] = 0x00;

CVE-2024-47742,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

firmware_loader: Block path traversal

Most firmware names are hardcoded strings, or are constructed from fairly
constrained format strings where the dynamic parts are just some hex
numbers or such.

However, there are a couple codepaths in the kernel where firmware file
names contain string components that are passed through from a device or
semi-privileged userspace; the ones I could find (not counting interfaces
that require root privileges) are:

 - lpfc_sli4_request_firmware_update() seems to construct the firmware
   filename from ""ModelName"", a string that was previously parsed out of
   some descriptor (""Vital Product Data"") in lpfc_fill_vpd()
 - nfp_net_fw_find() seems to construct a firmware filename from a model
   name coming from nfp_hwinfo_lookup(pf->hwinfo, ""nffw.partno""), which I
   think parses some descriptor that was read from the device.
   (But this case likely isn't exploitable because the format string looks
   like ""netronome/nic_%s"", and there shouldn't be any *folders* starting
   with ""netronome/nic_"". The previous case was different because there,
   the ""%s"" is *at the start* of the format string.)
 - module_flash_fw_schedule() is reachable from the
   ETHTOOL_MSG_MODULE_FW_FLASH_ACT netlink command, which is marked as
   GENL_UNS_ADMIN_PERM (meaning CAP_NET_ADMIN inside a user namespace is
   enough to pass the privilege check), and takes a userspace-provided
   firmware name.
   (But I think to reach this case, you need to have CAP_NET_ADMIN over a
   network namespace that a special kind of ethernet device is mapped into,
   so I think this is not a viable attack path in practice.)

Fix it by rejecting any firmware names containing "".."" path components.

For what it's worth, I went looking and haven't found any USB device
drivers that use the firmware loader dangerously.",'-,7.8,6021727,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7293-1),5,5,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 27, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,176482162,PTDTC-SV-TOOLS.portugal.pt,"10.1.1.246,10.88.0.246","fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:970,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:4a42",Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7293-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7293-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,35,4,"Feb 26, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",Ubuntu,CRITICAL,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 20.04.6,'-,'-,24,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,237,,"#table cols=""3""

nilfs2: fix kernel bug due to missing clearing of buffer delay flag

Syzbot reported that after nilfs2 reads a corrupted file system image
and degrades to read-only, the BUG_ON check for the buffer delay flag
in submit_bh_wbc() may fail, causing a kernel bug.

This is because the buffer delay flag is not cleared when clearing the
buffer state flags to discard a page/folio or a buffer head. So, fix
this.

This became necessary when the use of nilfs2's own page clear routine
was expanded.  This state inconsistency does not occur if the buffer

wifi: iwlegacy: Clear stale interrupts before resuming device

iwl4965 fails upon resume from hibernation on my laptop. The reason
seems to be a stale interrupt which isn't being cleared out before
interrupts are enabled. We end up with a race beween the resume
trying to bring things back up, and the restart work (queued form
the interrupt handler) trying to bring things down. Eventually
the whole thing blows up.

Fix the problem by clearing out any stale interrupts before
interrupts get enabled during resume.

CVE-2024-50195,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

posix-clock: Fix missing timespec64 check in pc_clock_settime()

As Andrew pointed out, it will make sense that the PTP core
checked timespec64 struct's tv_sec and tv_nsec range before calling
ptp->info->settime64().

As the man manual of clock_settime() said, if tp.tv_sec is negative or
tp.tv_nsec is outside the range [0..999,999,999], it should return EINVAL,
which include dynamic clocks which handles PTP clock, and the condition is
consistent with timespec64_valid(). As Thomas suggested, timespec64_valid()
only check the timespec is valid, but not ensure that the time is
in a valid range, so check it ahead using timespec64_valid_strict()
in pc_clock_settime() and return -EINVAL if not valid.

There are some drivers that use tp->tv_sec and tp->tv_nsec directly to
write registers without validity checks and assume that the higher layer
has checked it, which is dangerous and will benefit from this, such as
hclge_ptp_settime(), igb_ptp_settime_i210(), _rcar_gen4_ptp_settime(),

parport: Proper fix for array out-of-bounds access

The recent fix for array out-of-bounds accesses replaced sprintf()
calls blindly with snprintf().  However, since snprintf() returns the

calculation can still go over the given limit.

ext4: fix i_data_sem unlock order in ext4_ind_migrate()

Fuzzing reports a possible deadlock in jbd2_log_wait_commit.

This issue is triggered when an EXT4_IOC_MIGRATE ioctl is set to require
synchronous updates because the file descriptor is opened with O_SYNC.
This can lead to the jbd2_journal_stop() function calling
jbd2_might_wait_for_commit(), potentially causing a deadlock if the
EXT4_IOC_MIGRATE call races with a write(2) system call.

This problem only arises when CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING is enabled. In this
case, the jbd2_might_wait_for_commit macro locks jbd2_handle in the
jbd2_journal_stop function while i_data_sem is locked. This triggers
lockdep because the jbd2_journal_start function might also lock the same
jbd2_handle simultaneously.

CVE-2024-47757,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nilfs2: fix potential oob read in nilfs_btree_check_delete()

The function nilfs_btree_check_delete(), which checks whether degeneration
to direct mapping occurs before deleting a b-tree entry, causes memory
access outside the block buffer when retrieving the maximum key if the
root node has no entries.

This does not usually happen because b-tree mappings with 0 child nodes
are never created by mkfs.nilfs2 or nilfs2 itself.  However, it can happen
if the b-tree root node read from a device is configured that way, so fix
this potential issue by adding a check for that case.",'-,7.1,6021727,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7293-1),5,5,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 27, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,176482162,PTDTC-SV-TOOLS.portugal.pt,"10.1.1.246,10.88.0.246","fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:970,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:4a42",Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7293-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7293-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,35,4,"Feb 26, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",Ubuntu,CRITICAL,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 20.04.6,'-,'-,24,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,237,,"#table cols=""3""

the private key exists in the ECDSA signature computation.

Impact summary: A timing side-channel in ECDSA signature computations
could allow recovering the private key by an attacker. However, measuring
the timing would require either local access to the signing application or
a very fast network connection with low latency.

There is a timing signal of around 300 nanoseconds when the top word of
the inverted ECDSA nonce value is zero. This can happen with significant
probability only for some of the supported elliptic curves. In particular
the NIST P-521 curve is affected. To be able to measure this leak, the attacker
process must either be located in the same physical computer or must
have a very fast network connection with low latency. For that reason

CVE-2024-9143,"Issue summary: Use of the low-level GF(2^m) elliptic curve APIs with untrusted
explicit values for the field polynomial can lead to out-of-bounds memory reads
or writes.

Impact summary: Out of bound memory writes can lead to an application crash or
even a possibility of a remote code execution, however, in all the protocols
involving Elliptic Curve Cryptography that we're aware of, either only ""named
curves"" are supported, or, if explicit curve parameters are supported, they
specify an X9.62 encoding of binary (GF(2^m)) curves that can't represent
problematic input values. Thus the likelihood of existence of a vulnerable
application is low.

In particular, the X9.62 encoding is used for ECC keys in X.509 certificates,
so problematic inputs cannot occur in the context of processing X.509
certificates.  Any problematic use-cases would have to be using an ""exotic""
curve encoding.

The affected APIs include: EC_GROUP_new_curve_GF2m(), EC_GROUP_new_from_params(),
and various supporting BN_GF2m_*() functions.

Applications working with ""exotic"" explicit binary (GF(2^m)) curve parameters,
that make it possible to represent invalid field polynomials with a zero
constant term, via the above or similar APIs, may terminate abruptly as a
result of reading or writing outside of array bounds.  Remote code execution
cannot easily be ruled out.

CVE-2024-53052,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

io_uring/rw: fix missing NOWAIT check for O_DIRECT start write

When io_uring starts a write, it'll call kiocb_start_write() to bump the
super block rwsem, preventing any freezes from happening while that
write is in-flight. The freeze side will grab that rwsem for writing,
excluding any new writers from happening and waiting for existing writes
to finish. But io_uring unconditionally uses kiocb_start_write(), which
will block if someone is currently attempting to freeze the mount point.
This causes a deadlock where freeze is waiting for previous writes to
complete, but the previous writes cannot complete, as the task that is
supposed to complete them is blocked waiting on starting a new write.
This results in the following stuck trace showing that dependency with
the write blocked starting a new write:

Fix this by having the io_uring side honor IOCB_NOWAIT, and only attempt a
blocking grab of the super block rwsem if it isn't set. For normal issue
where IOCB_NOWAIT would always be set, this returns -EAGAIN which will
have io_uring core issue a blocking attempt of the write. That will in

CVE-2024-50182,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

secretmem: disable memfd_secret() if arch cannot set direct map

Return -ENOSYS from memfd_secret() syscall if !can_set_direct_map().  This
is the case for example on some arm64 configurations, where marking 4k
PTEs in the direct map not present can only be done if the direct map is
set up at 4k granularity in the first place (as ARM's break-before-make
semantics do not easily allow breaking apart large/gigantic pages).

More precisely, on arm64 systems with !can_set_direct_map(),
set_direct_map_invalid_noflush() is a no-op, however it returns success
(0) instead of an error.  This means that memfd_secret will seemingly
""work"" (e.g.  syscall succeeds, you can mmap the fd and fault in pages),
but it does not actually achieve its goal of removing its memory from the
direct map.

Note that with this patch, memfd_secret() will start erroring on systems
where can_set_direct_map() returns false (arm64 with
CONFIG_RODATA_FULL_DEFAULT_ENABLED=n, CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC=n and
CONFIG_KFENCE=n), but that still seems better than the current silent
failure.  Since CONFIG_RODATA_FULL_DEFAULT_ENABLED defaults to 'y', most
arm64 systems actually have a working memfd_secret() and aren't be
affected.

From going through the iterations of the original memfd_secret patch
series, it seems that disabling the syscall in these scenarios was the
intended behavior [1] (preferred over having
set_direct_map_invalid_noflush return an error as that would result in
SIGBUSes at page-fault time), however the check for it got dropped between
v16 [2] and v17 [3], when secretmem moved away from CMA allocations.

CVE-2024-41066,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ibmvnic: Add tx check to prevent skb leak

Below is a summary of how the driver stores a reference to an skb during
transmit:
    tx_buff[free_map[consumer_index]]->skb = new_skb;
    free_map[consumer_index] = IBMVNIC_INVALID_MAP;
    consumer_index ++;
Where variable data looks like this:
    free_map == [4, IBMVNIC_INVALID_MAP, IBMVNIC_INVALID_MAP, 0, 3]
                                               	consumer_index^
    tx_buff == [skb=null, skb=<ptr>, skb=<ptr>, skb=null, skb=null]

The driver has checks to ensure that free_map[consumer_index] pointed to
a valid index but there was no check to ensure that this index pointed
to an unused/null skb address. So, if, by some chance, our free_map and
tx_buff lists become out of sync then we were previously risking an
skb memory leak. This could then cause tcp congestion control to stop
sending packets, eventually leading to ETIMEDOUT.

Therefore, add a conditional to ensure that the skb address is null. If
not then warn the user (because this is still a bug that should be
patched) and free the old pointer to prevent memleak/tcp problems.",'-,5.5,6021689,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7288-1),4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,264316421,ptdtc-sv-wzdsh1.portugal.pt,10.200.11.151,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:27a3,Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7288-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7288-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,30,5,"Feb 25, 2025","Feb 24, 2025",Ubuntu,HIGH,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 22.04.5,'-,'-,31,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,236,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-50194,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64: probes: Fix uprobes for big-endian kernels

The arm64 uprobes code is broken for big-endian kernels as it doesn't
convert the in-memory instruction encoding (which is always
little-endian) into the kernel's native endianness before analyzing and
simulating instructions. This may result in a few distinct problems:

* The kernel may may erroneously reject probing an instruction which can
  safely be probed.

* The kernel may erroneously erroneously permit stepping an
  instruction out-of-line when that instruction cannot be stepped
  out-of-line safely.

* The kernel may erroneously simulate instruction incorrectly dur to
  interpretting the byte-swapped encoding.

The endianness mismatch isn't caught by the compiler or sparse because:

* The arch_uprobe::{insn,ixol} fields are encoded as arrays of u8, so
  the compiler and sparse have no idea these contain a little-endian
  32-bit value. The core uprobes code populates these with a memcpy()
  which similarly does not handle endianness.

* While the uprobe_opcode_t type is an alias for __le32, both
  arch_uprobe_analyze_insn() and arch_uprobe_skip_sstep() cast from u8[]
  to the similarly-named probe_opcode_t, which is an alias for u32.
  Hence there is no endianness conversion warning.

Fix this by changing the arch_uprobe::{insn,ixol} fields to __le32 and
adding the appropriate __le32_to_cpu() conversions prior to consuming
the instruction encoding. The core uprobes copies these fields as opaque
ranges of bytes, and so is unaffected by this change.

At the same time, remove MAX_UINSN_BYTES and consistently use
AARCH64_INSN_SIZE for clarity.

CVE-2024-50229,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nilfs2: fix potential deadlock with newly created symlinks

Syzbot reported that page_symlink(), called by nilfs_symlink(), triggers
memory reclamation involving the filesystem layer, which can result in
circular lock dependencies among the reader/writer semaphore
nilfs->ns_segctor_sem, s_writers percpu_rwsem (intwrite) and the
fs_reclaim pseudo lock.

This is because after commit 21fc61c73c39 (""don't put symlink bodies in
pagecache into highmem""), the gfp flags of the page cache for symbolic
links are overwritten to GFP_KERNEL via inode_nohighmem().

This is not a problem for symlinks read from the backing device, because
the __GFP_FS flag is dropped after inode_nohighmem() is called.  However,
when a new symlink is created with nilfs_symlink(), the gfp flags remain
overwritten to GFP_KERNEL.  Then, memory allocation called from
page_symlink() etc.  triggers memory reclamation including the FS layer,
which may call nilfs_evict_inode() or nilfs_dirty_inode().  And these can
cause a deadlock if they are called while nilfs->ns_segctor_sem is held:

Fix this issue by dropping the __GFP_FS flag from the page cache GFP flags
of newly created symlinks in the same way that nilfs_new_inode() and
__nilfs_read_inode() do, as a workaround until we adopt nofs allocation
scope consistently or improve the locking constraints.",'-,5.5,6021689,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7288-1),4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,264316421,ptdtc-sv-wzdsh1.portugal.pt,10.200.11.151,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:27a3,Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7288-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7288-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,30,5,"Feb 25, 2025","Feb 24, 2025",Ubuntu,HIGH,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 22.04.5,'-,'-,31,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,236,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-53058,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: stmmac: TSO: Fix unbalanced DMA map/unmap for non-paged SKB data

In case the non-paged data of a SKB carries protocol header and protocol
payload to be transmitted on a certain platform that the DMA AXI address
width is configured to 40-bit/48-bit, or the size of the non-paged data
is bigger than TSO_MAX_BUFF_SIZE on a certain platform that the DMA AXI
address width is configured to 32-bit, then this SKB requires at least
two DMA transmit descriptors to serve it.

For example, three descriptors are allocated to split one DMA buffer
mapped from one piece of non-paged data:
    dma_desc[N + 0],
    dma_desc[N + 1],
    dma_desc[N + 2].
Then three elements of tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[] will be allocated to hold
extra information to be reused in stmmac_tx_clean():
    tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[N + 0],
    tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[N + 1],
    tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[N + 2].
Now we focus on tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[entry].buf, which is the DMA buffer
address returned by DMA mapping call. stmmac_tx_clean() will try to
unmap the DMA buffer _ONLY_IF_ tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[entry].buf
is a valid buffer address.

The expected behavior that saves DMA buffer address of this non-paged
data to tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[entry].buf is:
    tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[N + 0].buf = NULL;
    tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[N + 1].buf = NULL;
    tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[N + 2].buf = dma_map_single();
Unfortunately, the current code misbehaves like this:
    tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[N + 0].buf = dma_map_single();
    tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[N + 1].buf = NULL;
    tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[N + 2].buf = NULL;

On the stmmac_tx_clean() side, when dma_desc[N + 0] is closed by the
DMA engine, tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[N + 0].buf is a valid buffer address
obviously, then the DMA buffer will be unmapped immediately.
There may be a rare case that the DMA engine does not finish the
pending dma_desc[N + 1], dma_desc[N + 2] yet. Now things will go
horribly wrong, DMA is going to access a unmapped/unreferenced memory
region, corrupted data will be transmited or iommu fault will be
triggered :(

In contrast, the for-loop that maps SKB fragments behaves perfectly
as expected, and that is how the driver should do for both non-paged
data and paged frags actually.

This patch corrects DMA map/unmap sequences by fixing the array index
for tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[entry].buf when assigning DMA buffer address.

drm/msm: Avoid NULL dereference in msm_disp_state_print_regs()

If the allocation in msm_disp_state_dump_regs() failed then
`block->state` can be NULL. The msm_disp_state_print_regs() function
_does_ have code to try to handle it with:

  if (*reg)
    dump_addr = *reg;

...but since ""dump_addr"" is initialized to NULL the above is actually
a noop. The code then goes on to dereference `dump_addr`.

Make the function print ""Registers not stored"" when it sees a NULL to
solve this. Since we're touching the code, fix
msm_disp_state_print_regs() not to pointlessly take a double-pointer
and properly mark the pointer as `const`.

CVE-2024-50278,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dm cache: fix potential out-of-bounds access on the first resume

Out-of-bounds access occurs if the fast device is expanded unexpectedly
before the first-time resume of the cache table. This happens because
expanding the fast device requires reloading the cache table for
cache_create to allocate new in-core data structures that fit the new
size, and the check in cache_preresume is not performed during the
first resume, leading to the issue.

Reproduce steps:

1. prepare component devices:

dmsetup create cmeta --table ""0 8192 linear /dev/sdc 0""
dmsetup create cdata --table ""0 65536 linear /dev/sdc 8192""
dmsetup create corig --table ""0 524288 linear /dev/sdc 262144""
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/mapper/cmeta bs=4k count=1 oflag=direct

2. load a cache table of 512 cache blocks, and deliberately expand the
   fast device before resuming the cache, making the in-core data
   structures inadequate.

dmsetup create cache --notable
dmsetup reload cache --table ""0 524288 cache /dev/mapper/cmeta \
/dev/mapper/cdata /dev/mapper/corig 128 2 metadata2 writethrough smq 0""
dmsetup reload cdata --table ""0 131072 linear /dev/sdc 8192""
dmsetup resume cdata
dmsetup resume cache

3. suspend the cache to write out the in-core dirty bitset and hint
   array, leading to out-of-bounds access to the dirty bitset at offset
   0x40:

dmsetup suspend cache

CVE-2024-50273,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: reinitialize delayed ref list after deleting it from the list

At insert_delayed_ref() if we need to update the action of an existing
ref to BTRFS_DROP_DELAYED_REF, we delete the ref from its ref head's
ref_add_list using list_del(), which leaves the ref's add_list member
not reinitialized, as list_del() sets the next and prev members of the
list to LIST_POISON1 and LIST_POISON2, respectively.

If later we end up calling drop_delayed_ref() against the ref, which can
happen during merging or when destroying delayed refs due to a transaction
abort, we can trigger a crash since at drop_delayed_ref() we call
list_empty() against the ref's add_list, which returns false since
the list was not reinitialized after the list_del() and as a consequence
we call list_del() again at drop_delayed_ref(). This results in an
invalid list access since the next and prev members are set to poison
pointers, resulting in a splat if CONFIG_LIST_HARDENED and
CONFIG_DEBUG_LIST are set or invalid poison pointer dereferences
otherwise.

  before using it.
  """"""

The commit 83fccfc3940c (""inet: fix potential deadlock in
reqsk_queue_unlink()"") added timer_pending() in reqsk_queue_unlink() not
to call del_timer_sync() from reqsk_timer_handler(), but it introduced a
small race window.

Before the timer is called, expire_timers() calls detach_timer(timer, true)
to clear timer->entry.pprev and marks it as not pending.

If reqsk_queue_unlink() checks timer_pending() just after expire_timers()
calls detach_timer(), TCP will miss del_timer_sync(); the reqsk timer will
continue running and send multiple SYN+ACKs until it expires.

The reported UAF could happen if req->sk is close()d earlier than the timer
expiration, which is 63s by default.

The scenario would be

  1. inet_csk_complete_hashdance() calls inet_csk_reqsk_queue_drop(),
     but del_timer_sync() is missed

  2. reqsk timer is executed and scheduled again

  3. req->sk is accept()ed and reqsk_put() decrements rsk_refcnt, but
     reqsk timer still has another one, and inet_csk_accept() does not
     clear req->sk for non-TFO sockets

  4. sk is close()d

  5. reqsk timer is executed again, and BPF touches req->sk

Let's not use timer_pending() by passing the caller context to
__inet_csk_reqsk_queue_drop().

Note that reqsk timer is pinned, so the issue does not happen in most
use cases. [1]

CVE-2024-50202,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nilfs2: propagate directory read errors from nilfs_find_entry()

Syzbot reported that a task hang occurs in vcs_open() during a fuzzing
test for nilfs2.

The root cause of this problem is that in nilfs_find_entry(), which
searches for directory entries, ignores errors when loading a directory
page/folio via nilfs_get_folio() fails.

If the filesystem images is corrupted, and the i_size of the directory
inode is large, and the directory page/folio is successfully read but
fails the sanity check, for example when it is zero-filled,
nilfs_check_folio() may continue to spit out error messages in bursts.

Fix this issue by propagating the error to the callers when loading a

CVE-2024-50162,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: devmap: provide rxq after redirect

rxq contains a pointer to the device from where
the redirect happened. Currently, the BPF program
that was executed after a redirect via BPF_MAP_TYPE_DEVMAP*
does not have it set.

This is particularly bad since accessing ingress_ifindex, e.g.

SEC(""xdp"")
int prog(struct xdp_md *pkt)
{
        return bpf_redirect_map(&dev_redirect_map, 0, 0);
}

SEC(""xdp/devmap"")
int prog_after_redirect(struct xdp_md *pkt)
{
        bpf_printk(""ifindex %i"", pkt->ingress_ifindex);
        return XDP_PASS;
}

depends on access to rxq, so a NULL pointer gets dereferenced:

CVE-2024-50163,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Make sure internal and UAPI bpf_redirect flags don't overlap

The bpf_redirect_info is shared between the SKB and XDP redirect paths,
and the two paths use the same numeric flag values in the ri->flags
field (specifically, BPF_F_BROADCAST == BPF_F_NEXTHOP). This means that
if skb bpf_redirect_neigh() is used with a non-NULL params argument and,
subsequently, an XDP redirect is performed using the same
bpf_redirect_info struct, the XDP path will get confused and end up
crashing, which syzbot managed to trigger.

With the stack-allocated bpf_redirect_info, the structure is no longer
shared between the SKB and XDP paths, so the crash doesn't happen
anymore. However, different code paths using identically-numbered flag
values in the same struct field still seems like a bit of a mess, so
this patch cleans that up by moving the flag definitions together and
redefining the three flags in BPF_F_REDIRECT_INTERNAL to not overlap
with the flags used for XDP. It also adds a BUILD_BUG_ON() check to make
sure the overlap is not re-introduced by mistake.",'-,5.5,6021689,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7288-1),4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,264316421,ptdtc-sv-wzdsh1.portugal.pt,10.200.11.151,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:27a3,Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7288-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7288-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,'-,5,"Feb 25, 2025","Feb 24, 2025",Ubuntu,HIGH,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 22.04.5,'-,'-,31,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,236,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-53097,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm: krealloc: Fix MTE false alarm in __do_krealloc

This patch addresses an issue introduced by commit 1a83a716ec233 (""mm:
krealloc: consider spare memory for __GFP_ZERO"") which causes MTE
(Memory Tagging Extension) to falsely report a slab-out-of-bounds error.

The problem occurs when zeroing out spare memory in __do_krealloc. The
original code only considered software-based KASAN and did not account
for MTE. It does not reset the KASAN tag before calling memset, leading
to a mismatch between the pointer tag and the memory tag, resulting
in a false positive.

i40e: fix race condition by adding filter's intermediate sync state

Fix a race condition in the i40e driver that leads to MAC/VLAN filters
becoming corrupted and leaking. Address the issue that occurs under
heavy load when multiple threads are concurrently modifying MAC/VLAN
filters by setting mac and port VLAN.

1. Thread T0 allocates a filter in i40e_add_filter() within
        i40e_ndo_set_vf_port_vlan().
2. Thread T1 concurrently frees the filter in __i40e_del_filter() within
        i40e_ndo_set_vf_mac().
3. Subsequently, i40e_service_task() calls i40e_sync_vsi_filters(), which
        refers to the already freed filter memory, causing corruption.

Reproduction steps:
1. Spawn multiple VFs.
2. Apply a concurrent heavy load by running parallel operations to change
        MAC addresses on the VFs and change port VLANs on the host.
3. Observe errors in dmesg:
""Error I40E_AQ_RC_ENOSPC adding RX filters on VF XX,
	please set promiscuous on manually for VF XX"".

Exact code for stable reproduction Intel can't open-source now.

The fix involves implementing a new intermediate filter state,
I40E_FILTER_NEW_SYNC, for the time when a filter is on a tmp_add_list.
These filters cannot be deleted from the hash list directly but
must be removed using the full process.",'-,4.7,6021689,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7288-1),4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,264316421,ptdtc-sv-wzdsh1.portugal.pt,10.200.11.151,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:27a3,Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7288-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7288-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,'-,5,"Feb 25, 2025","Feb 24, 2025",Ubuntu,HIGH,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 22.04.5,'-,'-,31,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,236,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-50010,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

exec: don't WARN for racy path_noexec check

Both i_mode and noexec checks wrapped in WARN_ON stem from an artifact
of the previous implementation. They used to legitimately check for the
condition, but that got moved up in two commits:
633fb6ac3980 (""exec: move S_ISREG() check earlier"")
0fd338b2d2cd (""exec: move path_noexec() check earlier"")

Instead of being removed said checks are WARN_ON'ed instead, which
has some debug value.

However, the spurious path_noexec check is racy, resulting in
unwarranted warnings should someone race with setting the noexec flag.

One can note there is more to perm-checking whether execve is allowed
and none of the conditions are guaranteed to still hold after they were
tested for.

Additionally this does not validate whether the code path did any perm
checking to begin with -- it will pass if the inode happens to be
regular.

Keep the redundant path_noexec() check even though it's mindless
nonsense checking for guarantee that isn't given so drop the WARN.

Reword the commentary and do small tidy ups while here.

CVE-2024-50099,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64: probes: Remove broken LDR (literal) uprobe support

The simulate_ldr_literal() and simulate_ldrsw_literal() functions are
unsafe to use for uprobes. Both functions were originally written for
use with kprobes, and access memory with plain C accesses. When uprobes
was added, these were reused unmodified even though they cannot safely
access user memory.

There are three key problems:

1) The plain C accesses do not have corresponding extable entries, and
   thus if they encounter a fault the kernel will treat these as
   unintentional accesses to user memory, resulting in a BUG() which
   will kill the kernel thread, and likely lead to further issues (e.g.
   lockup or panic()).

2) The plain C accesses are subject to HW PAN and SW PAN, and so when
   either is in use, any attempt to simulate an access to user memory
   will fault. Thus neither simulate_ldr_literal() nor
   simulate_ldrsw_literal() can do anything useful when simulating a
   user instruction on any system with HW PAN or SW PAN.

3) The plain C accesses are privileged, as they run in kernel context,
   and in practice can access a small range of kernel virtual addresses.
   The instructions they simulate have a range of +/-1MiB, and since the
   simulated instructions must itself be a user instructions in the
   TTBR0 address range, these can address the final 1MiB of the TTBR1
   acddress range by wrapping downwards from an address in the first
   1MiB of the TTBR0 address range.

   In contemporary kernels the last 8MiB of TTBR1 address range is
   reserved, and accesses to this will always fault, meaning this is no
   worse than (1).

   Historically, it was theoretically possible for the linear map or
   vmemmap to spill into the final 8MiB of the TTBR1 address range, but
   in practice this is extremely unlikely to occur as this would
   require either:

   * Having enough physical memory to fill the entire linear map all the
     way to the final 1MiB of the TTBR1 address range.

   * Getting unlucky with KASLR randomization of the linear map such
     that the populated region happens to overlap with the last 1MiB of
     the TTBR address range.

   ... and in either case if we were to spill into the final page there
   would be larger problems as the final page would alias with error
   pointers.

Practically speaking, (1) and (2) are the big issues. Given there have
been no reports of problems since the broken code was introduced, it
appears that no-one is relying on probing these instructions with
uprobes.

Avoid these issues by not allowing uprobes on LDR (literal) and LDRSW
(literal), limiting the use of simulate_ldr_literal() and
simulate_ldrsw_literal() to kprobes. Attempts to place uprobes on LDR
(literal) and LDRSW (literal) will be rejected as
arm_probe_decode_insn() will return INSN_REJECTED. In future we can
consider introducing working uprobes support for these instructions, but
this will require more significant work.",'-,5.5,6021689,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7288-1),4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,264316421,ptdtc-sv-wzdsh1.portugal.pt,10.200.11.151,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:27a3,Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7288-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7288-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,30,5,"Feb 25, 2025","Feb 24, 2025",Ubuntu,HIGH,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 22.04.5,'-,'-,31,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,236,,"#table cols=""3""

This issue was also reported by syzbot.

It can be reproduced by following these steps(more details [1]):
1. Obtain more than 32 inputs that have similar hashes, which ends with the
   pattern '0xxxxxxxe6'.
2. Reboot and add the keys obtained in step 1.

The reproducer demonstrates how this issue happened:
1. In the search_nested_keyrings function, when it iterates through the
   slots in a node(below tag ascend_to_node), if the slot pointer is meta
   and node->back_pointer != NULL(it means a root), it will proceed to
   descend_to_node. However, there is an exception. If node is the root,
   and one of the slots points to a shortcut, it will be treated as a
   keyring.
2. Whether the ptr is keyring decided by keyring_ptr_is_keyring function.
   However, KEYRING_PTR_SUBTYPE is 0x2UL, the same as
   ASSOC_ARRAY_PTR_SUBTYPE_MASK.
3. When 32 keys with the similar hashes are added to the tree, the ROOT
   has keys with hashes that are not similar (e.g. slot 0) and it splits
   NODE A without using a shortcut. When NODE A is filled with keys that
   all hashes are xxe6, the keys are similar, NODE A will split with a
   shortcut. Finally, it forms the tree as shown below, where slot 6 points
   to a shortcut.

                      NODE A
              +------>+---+
      ROOT    |       | 0 | xxe6
      +---+   |       +---+
 xxxx | 0 | shortcut  :   : xxe6
      +---+   |       +---+
 xxe6 :   :   |       |   | xxe6
      +---+   |       +---+
      | 6 |---+       :   : xxe6
      +---+           +---+
 xxe6 :   :           | f | xxe6
      +---+           +---+
 xxe6 | f |
      +---+

4. As mentioned above, If a slot(slot 6) of the root points to a shortcut,
   it may be mistakenly transferred to a key*, leading to a read
   out-of-bounds read.

To fix this issue, one should jump to descend_to_node if the ptr is a
shortcut, regardless of whether the node is root or not.

CVE-2024-50141,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ACPI: PRM: Find EFI_MEMORY_RUNTIME block for PRM handler and context

PRMT needs to find the correct type of block to translate the PA-VA
mapping for EFI runtime services.

The issue arises because the PRMT is finding a block of type
EFI_CONVENTIONAL_MEMORY, which is not appropriate for runtime services
as described in Section 2.2.2 (Runtime Services) of the UEFI
Specification [1]. Since the PRM handler is a type of runtime service,
this causes an exception when the PRM handler is called.

    [Firmware Bug]: Unable to handle paging request in EFI runtime service
    WARNING: CPU: 22 PID: 4330 at drivers/firmware/efi/runtime-wrappers.c:341
        __efi_queue_work+0x11c/0x170
    Call trace:

Let PRMT find a block with EFI_MEMORY_RUNTIME for PRM handler and PRM
context.

If no suitable block is found, a warning message will be printed, but
the procedure continues to manage the next PRM handler.

However, if the PRM handler is actually called without proper allocation,
it would result in a failure during error handling.

By using the correct memory types for runtime services, ensure that the
PRM handler and the context are properly mapped in the virtual address
space during runtime, preventing the paging request error.

The issue is really that only memory that has been remapped for runtime
by the firmware can be used by the PRM handler, and so the region needs
to have the EFI_MEMORY_RUNTIME attribute.

So rq_qos_wake_function() calls wake_up_process(data->task), which calls
try_to_wake_up(), which faults in raw_spin_lock_irqsave(&p->pi_lock).

p comes from data->task, and data comes from the waitqueue entry, which
is stored on the waiter's stack in rq_qos_wait(). Analyzing the core
dump with drgn, I found that the waiter had already woken up and moved
on to a completely unrelated code path, clobbering what was previously
data->task. Meanwhile, the waker was passing the clobbered garbage in
data->task to wake_up_process(), leading to the crash.

What's happening is that in between rq_qos_wake_function() deleting the
waitqueue entry and calling wake_up_process(), rq_qos_wait() is finding
that it already got a token and returning. The race looks like this:

rq_qos_wait()                           rq_qos_wake_function()
==============================================================
prepare_to_wait_exclusive()
                                        data->got_token = true;
                                        list_del_init(&curr->entry);
if (data.got_token)
        break;
finish_wait(&rqw->wait, &data.wq);
  ^- returns immediately because
     list_empty_careful(&wq_entry->entry)
     is true
... return, go do something else ...
                                        wake_up_process(data->task)
                                          (NO LONGER VALID!)-^

Normally, finish_wait() is supposed to synchronize against the waker.
But, as noted above, it is returning immediately because the waitqueue
entry has already been removed from the waitqueue.

The bug is that rq_qos_wake_function() is accessing the waitqueue entry
AFTER deleting it. Note that autoremove_wake_function() wakes the waiter
and THEN deletes the waitqueue entry, which is the proper order.

Fix it by swapping the order. We also need to use
list_del_init_careful() to match the list_empty_careful() in
finish_wait().",'-,4.7,6021689,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7288-1),4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,264316421,ptdtc-sv-wzdsh1.portugal.pt,10.200.11.151,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:27a3,Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7288-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7288-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,30,5,"Feb 25, 2025","Feb 24, 2025",Ubuntu,HIGH,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 22.04.5,'-,'-,31,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,236,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-40953,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: Fix a data race on last_boosted_vcpu in kvm_vcpu_on_spin()

Use {READ,WRITE}_ONCE() to access kvm->last_boosted_vcpu to ensure the
loads and stores are atomic.  In the extremely unlikely scenario the
compiler tears the stores, it's theoretically possible for KVM to attempt
to get a vCPU using an out-of-bounds index, e.g. if the write is split
into multiple 8-bit stores, and is paired with a 32-bit load on a VM with
257 vCPUs:

  CPU0                              CPU1
  last_boosted_vcpu = 0xff;

                                    (last_boosted_vcpu = 0x100)
                                    last_boosted_vcpu[15:8] = 0x01;
  i = (last_boosted_vcpu = 0x1ff)
                                    last_boosted_vcpu[7:0] = 0x00;

  vcpu = kvm->vcpu_array[0x1ff];

CVE-2024-50115,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: nSVM: Ignore nCR3[4:0] when loading PDPTEs from memory

Ignore nCR3[4:0] when loading PDPTEs from memory for nested SVM, as bits
4:0 of CR3 are ignored when PAE paging is used, and thus VMRUN doesn't
enforce 32-byte alignment of nCR3.

In the absolute worst case scenario, failure to ignore bits 4:0 can result
in an out-of-bounds read, e.g. if the target page is at the end of a
memslot, and the VMM isn't using guard pages.

Per the APM:

  The CR3 register points to the base address of the page-directory-pointer
  table. The page-directory-pointer table is aligned on a 32-byte boundary,
  with the low 5 address bits 4:0 assumed to be 0.

And the SDM's much more explicit:

  4:0    Ignored

Note, KVM gets this right when loading PDPTRs, it's only the nSVM flow
that is broken.",'-,7.1,6021689,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7288-1),4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,264316421,ptdtc-sv-wzdsh1.portugal.pt,10.200.11.151,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:27a3,Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7288-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7288-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,35,5,"Feb 25, 2025","Feb 24, 2025",Ubuntu,HIGH,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 22.04.5,'-,'-,31,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,236,,"#table cols=""3""

Syzbot reported that after nilfs2 reads a corrupted file system image

This is because the buffer delay flag is not cleared when clearing the

this.

the interrupt handler) trying to bring things down. Eventually
the whole thing blows up.

parport: Proper fix for array out-of-bounds access

The recent fix for array out-of-bounds accesses replaced sprintf()
calls blindly with snprintf().  However, since snprintf() returns the

CVE-2024-50195,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

posix-clock: Fix missing timespec64 check in pc_clock_settime()

As Andrew pointed out, it will make sense that the PTP core
checked timespec64 struct's tv_sec and tv_nsec range before calling
ptp->info->settime64().

As the man manual of clock_settime() said, if tp.tv_sec is negative or
tp.tv_nsec is outside the range [0..999,999,999], it should return EINVAL,
which include dynamic clocks which handles PTP clock, and the condition is
consistent with timespec64_valid(). As Thomas suggested, timespec64_valid()
only check the timespec is valid, but not ensure that the time is
in a valid range, so check it ahead using timespec64_valid_strict()
in pc_clock_settime() and return -EINVAL if not valid.

There are some drivers that use tp->tv_sec and tp->tv_nsec directly to
write registers without validity checks and assume that the higher layer
has checked it, which is dangerous and will benefit from this, such as
hclge_ptp_settime(), igb_ptp_settime_i210(), _rcar_gen4_ptp_settime(),
and some drivers can remove the checks of itself.",'-,5.5,6021689,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7288-1),4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,264316421,ptdtc-sv-wzdsh1.portugal.pt,10.200.11.151,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:27a3,Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7288-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7288-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,30,5,"Feb 25, 2025","Feb 24, 2025",Ubuntu,HIGH,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 22.04.5,'-,'-,31,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,236,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-50196,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

pinctrl: ocelot: fix system hang on level based interrupts

The current implementation only calls chained_irq_enter() and
chained_irq_exit() if it detects pending interrupts.

```
for (i = 0; i < info->stride; i++) {
	uregmap_read(info->map, id_reg + 4 * i, &reg);
	if (!reg)
		continue;

	chained_irq_enter(parent_chip, desc);
```

However, in case of GPIO pin configured in level mode and the parent
controller configured in edge mode, GPIO interrupt might be lowered by the
hardware. In the result, if the interrupt is short enough, the parent
interrupt is still pending while the GPIO interrupt is cleared;
chained_irq_enter() never gets called and the system hangs trying to
service the parent interrupt.

Moving chained_irq_enter() and chained_irq_exit() outside the for loop
ensures that they are called even when GPIO interrupt is lowered by the
hardware.

The similar code with chained_irq_enter() / chained_irq_exit() functions
wrapping interrupt checking loop may be found in many other drivers:

grep -r -A 10 chained_irq_enter drivers/pinctrl

CVE-2024-26718,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dm-crypt, dm-verity: disable tasklets

Tasklets have an inherent problem with memory corruption. The function
tasklet_action_common calls tasklet_trylock, then it calls the tasklet
callback and then it calls tasklet_unlock. If the tasklet callback frees
the structure that contains the tasklet or if it calls some code that may
free it, tasklet_unlock will write into free memory.

The commits 8e14f610159d and d9a02e016aaf try to fix it for dm-crypt, but
it is not a sufficient fix and the data corruption can still happen [1].
There is no fix for dm-verity and dm-verity will write into free memory
with every tasklet-processed bio.

There will be atomic workqueues implemented in the kernel 6.9 [2]. They
will have better interface and they will not suffer from the memory
corruption problem.

But we need something that stops the memory corruption now and that can be
backported to the stable kernels. So, I'm proposing this commit that
disables tasklets in both dm-crypt and dm-verity. This commit doesn't
remove the tasklet support, because the tasklet code will be reused when
atomic workqueues will be implemented.

CVE-2024-53052,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

io_uring/rw: fix missing NOWAIT check for O_DIRECT start write

When io_uring starts a write, it'll call kiocb_start_write() to bump the
super block rwsem, preventing any freezes from happening while that
write is in-flight. The freeze side will grab that rwsem for writing,
excluding any new writers from happening and waiting for existing writes
to finish. But io_uring unconditionally uses kiocb_start_write(), which
will block if someone is currently attempting to freeze the mount point.
This causes a deadlock where freeze is waiting for previous writes to
complete, but the previous writes cannot complete, as the task that is
supposed to complete them is blocked waiting on starting a new write.
This results in the following stuck trace showing that dependency with
the write blocked starting a new write:

Fix this by having the io_uring side honor IOCB_NOWAIT, and only attempt a
blocking grab of the super block rwsem if it isn't set. For normal issue
where IOCB_NOWAIT would always be set, this returns -EAGAIN which will
have io_uring core issue a blocking attempt of the write. That will in
turn also get completions run, ensuring forward progress.

CVE-2024-50182,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

secretmem: disable memfd_secret() if arch cannot set direct map

Return -ENOSYS from memfd_secret() syscall if !can_set_direct_map().  This
is the case for example on some arm64 configurations, where marking 4k
PTEs in the direct map not present can only be done if the direct map is
set up at 4k granularity in the first place (as ARM's break-before-make
semantics do not easily allow breaking apart large/gigantic pages).

More precisely, on arm64 systems with !can_set_direct_map(),
set_direct_map_invalid_noflush() is a no-op, however it returns success
(0) instead of an error.  This means that memfd_secret will seemingly
""work"" (e.g.  syscall succeeds, you can mmap the fd and fault in pages),
but it does not actually achieve its goal of removing its memory from the
direct map.

Note that with this patch, memfd_secret() will start erroring on systems
where can_set_direct_map() returns false (arm64 with
CONFIG_RODATA_FULL_DEFAULT_ENABLED=n, CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC=n and
CONFIG_KFENCE=n), but that still seems better than the current silent
failure.  Since CONFIG_RODATA_FULL_DEFAULT_ENABLED defaults to 'y', most
arm64 systems actually have a working memfd_secret() and aren't be
affected.

From going through the iterations of the original memfd_secret patch
series, it seems that disabling the syscall in these scenarios was the
intended behavior [1] (preferred over having
set_direct_map_invalid_noflush return an error as that would result in
SIGBUSes at page-fault time), however the check for it got dropped between
v16 [2] and v17 [3], when secretmem moved away from CMA allocations.

    tx_buff == [skb=null, skb=<ptr>, skb=<ptr>, skb=null, skb=null]

The driver has checks to ensure that free_map[consumer_index] pointed to
a valid index but there was no check to ensure that this index pointed
to an unused/null skb address. So, if, by some chance, our free_map and
tx_buff lists become out of sync then we were previously risking an
skb memory leak. This could then cause tcp congestion control to stop
sending packets, eventually leading to ETIMEDOUT.

Therefore, add a conditional to ensure that the skb address is null. If
not then warn the user (because this is still a bug that should be
patched) and free the old pointer to prevent memleak/tcp problems.",'-,5.5,6021689,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7288-1),4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,231339923,ryder,"10.200.1.77,172.17.0.1,172.20.0.1","fe80:0:0:0:42:96ff:fe0f:3a59,fe80:0:0:0:42:c5ff:fec9:2551,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:da46,fe80:0:0:0:4034:56ff:fe5b:9bca,fe80:0:0:0:40a7:6dff:fec7:2075,fe80:0:0:0:f868:12ff:fe5a:fc42",Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7288-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7288-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,30,5,"Feb 25, 2025","Feb 24, 2025",Ubuntu,HIGH,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 22.04.4,'-,'-,29,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,336,,"#table cols=""3""

the commit assumes, uport can be NULL in there. But right after that

CVE-2024-50194,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64: probes: Fix uprobes for big-endian kernels

The arm64 uprobes code is broken for big-endian kernels as it doesn't
convert the in-memory instruction encoding (which is always
little-endian) into the kernel's native endianness before analyzing and
simulating instructions. This may result in a few distinct problems:

* The kernel may may erroneously reject probing an instruction which can
  safely be probed.

* The kernel may erroneously erroneously permit stepping an
  instruction out-of-line when that instruction cannot be stepped
  out-of-line safely.

* The kernel may erroneously simulate instruction incorrectly dur to
  interpretting the byte-swapped encoding.

The endianness mismatch isn't caught by the compiler or sparse because:

* The arch_uprobe::{insn,ixol} fields are encoded as arrays of u8, so
  the compiler and sparse have no idea these contain a little-endian
  32-bit value. The core uprobes code populates these with a memcpy()
  which similarly does not handle endianness.

* While the uprobe_opcode_t type is an alias for __le32, both
  arch_uprobe_analyze_insn() and arch_uprobe_skip_sstep() cast from u8[]
  to the similarly-named probe_opcode_t, which is an alias for u32.
  Hence there is no endianness conversion warning.

Fix this by changing the arch_uprobe::{insn,ixol} fields to __le32 and
adding the appropriate __le32_to_cpu() conversions prior to consuming
the instruction encoding. The core uprobes copies these fields as opaque
ranges of bytes, and so is unaffected by this change.

At the same time, remove MAX_UINSN_BYTES and consistently use
AARCH64_INSN_SIZE for clarity.

Tested with the following:

| #include <stdio.h>
| #include <stdbool.h>
|
| #define noinline __attribute__((noinline))
|
| static noinline void *adrp_self(void)
| {

|         ""       adrp    %x0, adrp_self\n""
|         ""       add     %x0, %x0, :lo12:adrp_self\n""
|         : ""=r"" (addr));
| }
|
|
| int main(int argc, char *argv)
| {
|         void *ptr = adrp_self();

|                adrp_self, ptr, equal ? ""EQUAL"" : ""NOT EQUAL"");
|
|         return 0;
| }

.... where the adrp_self() function was compiled to:

| 00000000004007e0 <adrp_self>:

|   4007e8:       d65f03c0        ret

Before this patch, the ADRP is not recognized, and is assumed to be
steppable, resulting in corruption of the result:

| # ./adrp-self
| adrp_self   => 0x4007e0

| # ./adrp-self
| adrp_self   => 0x4007e0
| adrp_self() => 0xffffffffff7e0
| NOT EQUAL

After this patch, the ADRP is correctly recognized and simulated:

| # ./adrp-self
| adrp_self   => 0x4007e0
| adrp_self() => 0x4007e0
| EQUAL

CVE-2024-50229,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nilfs2: fix potential deadlock with newly created symlinks

Syzbot reported that page_symlink(), called by nilfs_symlink(), triggers
memory reclamation involving the filesystem layer, which can result in
circular lock dependencies among the reader/writer semaphore
nilfs->ns_segctor_sem, s_writers percpu_rwsem (intwrite) and the
fs_reclaim pseudo lock.

This is because after commit 21fc61c73c39 (""don't put symlink bodies in
pagecache into highmem""), the gfp flags of the page cache for symbolic
links are overwritten to GFP_KERNEL via inode_nohighmem().

This is not a problem for symlinks read from the backing device, because
the __GFP_FS flag is dropped after inode_nohighmem() is called.  However,
when a new symlink is created with nilfs_symlink(), the gfp flags remain
overwritten to GFP_KERNEL.  Then, memory allocation called from
page_symlink() etc.  triggers memory reclamation including the FS layer,
which may call nilfs_evict_inode() or nilfs_dirty_inode().  And these can
cause a deadlock if they are called while nilfs->ns_segctor_sem is held:

Fix this issue by dropping the __GFP_FS flag from the page cache GFP flags
of newly created symlinks in the same way that nilfs_new_inode() and
__nilfs_read_inode() do, as a workaround until we adopt nofs allocation
scope consistently or improve the locking constraints.",'-,5.5,6021689,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7288-1),4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,231339923,ryder,"10.200.1.77,172.17.0.1,172.20.0.1","fe80:0:0:0:42:96ff:fe0f:3a59,fe80:0:0:0:42:c5ff:fec9:2551,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:da46,fe80:0:0:0:4034:56ff:fe5b:9bca,fe80:0:0:0:40a7:6dff:fec7:2075,fe80:0:0:0:f868:12ff:fe5a:fc42",Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7288-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7288-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,30,5,"Feb 25, 2025","Feb 24, 2025",Ubuntu,HIGH,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 22.04.4,'-,'-,29,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,336,,"#table cols=""3""

is bigger than TSO_MAX_BUFF_SIZE on a certain platform that the DMA AXI
address width is configured to 32-bit, then this SKB requires at least
two DMA transmit descriptors to serve it.

For example, three descriptors are allocated to split one DMA buffer
mapped from one piece of non-paged data:
    dma_desc[N + 0],
    dma_desc[N + 1],
    dma_desc[N + 2].
Then three elements of tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[] will be allocated to hold
extra information to be reused in stmmac_tx_clean():
    tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[N + 0],
    tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[N + 1],
    tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[N + 2].
Now we focus on tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[entry].buf, which is the DMA buffer
address returned by DMA mapping call. stmmac_tx_clean() will try to
unmap the DMA buffer _ONLY_IF_ tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[entry].buf
is a valid buffer address.

The expected behavior that saves DMA buffer address of this non-paged
data to tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[entry].buf is:
    tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[N + 0].buf = NULL;
    tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[N + 1].buf = NULL;
    tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[N + 2].buf = dma_map_single();
Unfortunately, the current code misbehaves like this:
    tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[N + 0].buf = dma_map_single();
    tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[N + 1].buf = NULL;
    tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[N + 2].buf = NULL;

On the stmmac_tx_clean() side, when dma_desc[N + 0] is closed by the
DMA engine, tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[N + 0].buf is a valid buffer address
obviously, then the DMA buffer will be unmapped immediately.
There may be a rare case that the DMA engine does not finish the
pending dma_desc[N + 1], dma_desc[N + 2] yet. Now things will go
horribly wrong, DMA is going to access a unmapped/unreferenced memory
region, corrupted data will be transmited or iommu fault will be
triggered :(

In contrast, the for-loop that maps SKB fragments behaves perfectly
as expected, and that is how the driver should do for both non-paged
data and paged frags actually.

This patch corrects DMA map/unmap sequences by fixing the array index
for tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[entry].buf when assigning DMA buffer address.

CVE-2024-50156,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/msm: Avoid NULL dereference in msm_disp_state_print_regs()

If the allocation in msm_disp_state_dump_regs() failed then
`block->state` can be NULL. The msm_disp_state_print_regs() function
_does_ have code to try to handle it with:

  if (*reg)
    dump_addr = *reg;

...but since ""dump_addr"" is initialized to NULL the above is actually
a noop. The code then goes on to dereference `dump_addr`.

Make the function print ""Registers not stored"" when it sees a NULL to
solve this. Since we're touching the code, fix
msm_disp_state_print_regs() not to pointlessly take a double-pointer
and properly mark the pointer as `const`.

CVE-2024-50278,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dm cache: fix potential out-of-bounds access on the first resume

Out-of-bounds access occurs if the fast device is expanded unexpectedly
before the first-time resume of the cache table. This happens because
expanding the fast device requires reloading the cache table for
cache_create to allocate new in-core data structures that fit the new
size, and the check in cache_preresume is not performed during the
first resume, leading to the issue.

Reproduce steps:

1. prepare component devices:

dmsetup create cmeta --table ""0 8192 linear /dev/sdc 0""
dmsetup create cdata --table ""0 65536 linear /dev/sdc 8192""
dmsetup create corig --table ""0 524288 linear /dev/sdc 262144""
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/mapper/cmeta bs=4k count=1 oflag=direct

2. load a cache table of 512 cache blocks, and deliberately expand the
   fast device before resuming the cache, making the in-core data
   structures inadequate.

dmsetup create cache --notable
dmsetup reload cache --table ""0 524288 cache /dev/mapper/cmeta \
/dev/mapper/cdata /dev/mapper/corig 128 2 metadata2 writethrough smq 0""
dmsetup reload cdata --table ""0 131072 linear /dev/sdc 8192""
dmsetup resume cdata
dmsetup resume cache

3. suspend the cache to write out the in-core dirty bitset and hint
   array, leading to out-of-bounds access to the dirty bitset at offset
   0x40:

dmsetup suspend cache

CVE-2024-50273,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: reinitialize delayed ref list after deleting it from the list

At insert_delayed_ref() if we need to update the action of an existing
ref to BTRFS_DROP_DELAYED_REF, we delete the ref from its ref head's
ref_add_list using list_del(), which leaves the ref's add_list member
not reinitialized, as list_del() sets the next and prev members of the
list to LIST_POISON1 and LIST_POISON2, respectively.

If later we end up calling drop_delayed_ref() against the ref, which can
happen during merging or when destroying delayed refs due to a transaction
abort, we can trigger a crash since at drop_delayed_ref() we call
list_empty() against the ref's add_list, which returns false since
the list was not reinitialized after the list_del() and as a consequence
we call list_del() again at drop_delayed_ref(). This results in an
invalid list access since the next and prev members are set to poison
pointers, resulting in a splat if CONFIG_LIST_HARDENED and
CONFIG_DEBUG_LIST are set or invalid poison pointer dereferences
otherwise.

So fix this by deleting from the list with list_del_init() instead.",'-,5.5,6021689,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7288-1),4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,231339923,ryder,"10.200.1.77,172.17.0.1,172.20.0.1","fe80:0:0:0:42:96ff:fe0f:3a59,fe80:0:0:0:42:c5ff:fec9:2551,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:da46,fe80:0:0:0:4034:56ff:fe5b:9bca,fe80:0:0:0:40a7:6dff:fec7:2075,fe80:0:0:0:f868:12ff:fe5a:fc42",Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7288-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7288-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,'-,5,"Feb 25, 2025","Feb 24, 2025",Ubuntu,HIGH,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 22.04.4,'-,'-,29,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,336,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-50154,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tcp/dccp: Don't use timer_pending() in reqsk_queue_unlink().

Martin KaFai Lau reported use-after-free [0] in reqsk_timer_handler().

  """"""
  We are seeing a use-after-free from a bpf prog attached to
  trace_tcp_retransmit_synack. The program passes the req->sk to the
  bpf_sk_storage_get_tracing kernel helper which does check for null
  before using it.
  """"""

The commit 83fccfc3940c (""inet: fix potential deadlock in
reqsk_queue_unlink()"") added timer_pending() in reqsk_queue_unlink() not
to call del_timer_sync() from reqsk_timer_handler(), but it introduced a
small race window.

Before the timer is called, expire_timers() calls detach_timer(timer, true)
to clear timer->entry.pprev and marks it as not pending.

If reqsk_queue_unlink() checks timer_pending() just after expire_timers()
calls detach_timer(), TCP will miss del_timer_sync(); the reqsk timer will
continue running and send multiple SYN+ACKs until it expires.

The reported UAF could happen if req->sk is close()d earlier than the timer
expiration, which is 63s by default.

The scenario would be

  1. inet_csk_complete_hashdance() calls inet_csk_reqsk_queue_drop(),
     but del_timer_sync() is missed

  2. reqsk timer is executed and scheduled again

  3. req->sk is accept()ed and reqsk_put() decrements rsk_refcnt, but
     reqsk timer still has another one, and inet_csk_accept() does not
     clear req->sk for non-TFO sockets

  4. sk is close()d

  5. reqsk timer is executed again, and BPF touches req->sk

Let's not use timer_pending() by passing the caller context to
__inet_csk_reqsk_queue_drop().

Note that reqsk timer is pinned, so the issue does not happen in most
use cases. [1]

CVE-2024-50202,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nilfs2: propagate directory read errors from nilfs_find_entry()

Syzbot reported that a task hang occurs in vcs_open() during a fuzzing
test for nilfs2.

The root cause of this problem is that in nilfs_find_entry(), which
searches for directory entries, ignores errors when loading a directory
page/folio via nilfs_get_folio() fails.

If the filesystem images is corrupted, and the i_size of the directory
inode is large, and the directory page/folio is successfully read but
fails the sanity check, for example when it is zero-filled,
nilfs_check_folio() may continue to spit out error messages in bursts.

Fix this issue by propagating the error to the callers when loading a
page/folio fails in nilfs_find_entry().

The current interface of nilfs_find_entry() and its callers is outdated
and cannot propagate error codes such as -EIO and -ENOMEM returned via
nilfs_find_entry(), so fix it together.",'-,5.5,6021689,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7288-1),4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,231339923,ryder,"10.200.1.77,172.17.0.1,172.20.0.1","fe80:0:0:0:42:96ff:fe0f:3a59,fe80:0:0:0:42:c5ff:fec9:2551,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:da46,fe80:0:0:0:4034:56ff:fe5b:9bca,fe80:0:0:0:40a7:6dff:fec7:2075,fe80:0:0:0:f868:12ff:fe5a:fc42",Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7288-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7288-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,30,5,"Feb 25, 2025","Feb 24, 2025",Ubuntu,HIGH,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 22.04.4,'-,'-,29,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,336,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-50162,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: devmap: provide rxq after redirect

rxq contains a pointer to the device from where
the redirect happened. Currently, the BPF program
that was executed after a redirect via BPF_MAP_TYPE_DEVMAP*
does not have it set.

This is particularly bad since accessing ingress_ifindex, e.g.

SEC(""xdp"")
int prog(struct xdp_md *pkt)
{
        return bpf_redirect_map(&dev_redirect_map, 0, 0);
}

SEC(""xdp/devmap"")
int prog_after_redirect(struct xdp_md *pkt)
{
        bpf_printk(""ifindex %i"", pkt->ingress_ifindex);
        return XDP_PASS;
}

depends on access to rxq, so a NULL pointer gets dereferenced:

drm/i915: Fix potential context UAFs

gem_context_register() makes the context visible to userspace, and which
point a separate thread can trigger the I915_GEM_CONTEXT_DESTROY ioctl.
So we need to ensure that nothing uses the ctx ptr after this.  And we
need to ensure that adding the ctx to the xarray is the *last* thing
that gem_context_register() does with the ctx pointer.

CVE-2024-50163,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Make sure internal and UAPI bpf_redirect flags don't overlap

The bpf_redirect_info is shared between the SKB and XDP redirect paths,
and the two paths use the same numeric flag values in the ri->flags
field (specifically, BPF_F_BROADCAST == BPF_F_NEXTHOP). This means that
if skb bpf_redirect_neigh() is used with a non-NULL params argument and,
subsequently, an XDP redirect is performed using the same
bpf_redirect_info struct, the XDP path will get confused and end up
crashing, which syzbot managed to trigger.

With the stack-allocated bpf_redirect_info, the structure is no longer
shared between the SKB and XDP paths, so the crash doesn't happen
anymore. However, different code paths using identically-numbered flag
values in the same struct field still seems like a bit of a mess, so
this patch cleans that up by moving the flag definitions together and
redefining the three flags in BPF_F_REDIRECT_INTERNAL to not overlap
with the flags used for XDP. It also adds a BUILD_BUG_ON() check to make
sure the overlap is not re-introduced by mistake.",'-,5.5,6021689,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7288-1),4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,231339923,ryder,"10.200.1.77,172.17.0.1,172.20.0.1","fe80:0:0:0:42:96ff:fe0f:3a59,fe80:0:0:0:42:c5ff:fec9:2551,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:da46,fe80:0:0:0:4034:56ff:fe5b:9bca,fe80:0:0:0:40a7:6dff:fec7:2075,fe80:0:0:0:f868:12ff:fe5a:fc42",Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7288-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7288-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,'-,5,"Feb 25, 2025","Feb 24, 2025",Ubuntu,HIGH,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 22.04.4,'-,'-,29,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,336,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-53097,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm: krealloc: Fix MTE false alarm in __do_krealloc

This patch addresses an issue introduced by commit 1a83a716ec233 (""mm:
krealloc: consider spare memory for __GFP_ZERO"") which causes MTE
(Memory Tagging Extension) to falsely report a slab-out-of-bounds error.

The problem occurs when zeroing out spare memory in __do_krealloc. The
original code only considered software-based KASAN and did not account
for MTE. It does not reset the KASAN tag before calling memset, leading
to a mismatch between the pointer tag and the memory tag, resulting
in a false positive.

CVE-2024-53088,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

i40e: fix race condition by adding filter's intermediate sync state

Fix a race condition in the i40e driver that leads to MAC/VLAN filters
becoming corrupted and leaking. Address the issue that occurs under
heavy load when multiple threads are concurrently modifying MAC/VLAN
filters by setting mac and port VLAN.

1. Thread T0 allocates a filter in i40e_add_filter() within
        i40e_ndo_set_vf_port_vlan().
2. Thread T1 concurrently frees the filter in __i40e_del_filter() within
        i40e_ndo_set_vf_mac().
3. Subsequently, i40e_service_task() calls i40e_sync_vsi_filters(), which
        refers to the already freed filter memory, causing corruption.

Reproduction steps:
1. Spawn multiple VFs.
2. Apply a concurrent heavy load by running parallel operations to change
        MAC addresses on the VFs and change port VLANs on the host.
3. Observe errors in dmesg:
""Error I40E_AQ_RC_ENOSPC adding RX filters on VF XX,
	please set promiscuous on manually for VF XX"".

Exact code for stable reproduction Intel can't open-source now.

The fix involves implementing a new intermediate filter state,
I40E_FILTER_NEW_SYNC, for the time when a filter is on a tmp_add_list.

CVE-2024-50010,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

exec: don't WARN for racy path_noexec check

Both i_mode and noexec checks wrapped in WARN_ON stem from an artifact
of the previous implementation. They used to legitimately check for the
condition, but that got moved up in two commits:
633fb6ac3980 (""exec: move S_ISREG() check earlier"")
0fd338b2d2cd (""exec: move path_noexec() check earlier"")

Instead of being removed said checks are WARN_ON'ed instead, which
has some debug value.

However, the spurious path_noexec check is racy, resulting in
unwarranted warnings should someone race with setting the noexec flag.

One can note there is more to perm-checking whether execve is allowed
and none of the conditions are guaranteed to still hold after they were
tested for.

Additionally this does not validate whether the code path did any perm
checking to begin with -- it will pass if the inode happens to be
regular.

Keep the redundant path_noexec() check even though it's mindless

CVE-2024-50099,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64: probes: Remove broken LDR (literal) uprobe support

The simulate_ldr_literal() and simulate_ldrsw_literal() functions are
unsafe to use for uprobes. Both functions were originally written for
use with kprobes, and access memory with plain C accesses. When uprobes
was added, these were reused unmodified even though they cannot safely
access user memory.

There are three key problems:

1) The plain C accesses do not have corresponding extable entries, and
   thus if they encounter a fault the kernel will treat these as
   unintentional accesses to user memory, resulting in a BUG() which
   will kill the kernel thread, and likely lead to further issues (e.g.
   lockup or panic()).

2) The plain C accesses are subject to HW PAN and SW PAN, and so when
   either is in use, any attempt to simulate an access to user memory
   will fault. Thus neither simulate_ldr_literal() nor
   simulate_ldrsw_literal() can do anything useful when simulating a
   user instruction on any system with HW PAN or SW PAN.

3) The plain C accesses are privileged, as they run in kernel context,
   and in practice can access a small range of kernel virtual addresses.
   The instructions they simulate have a range of +/-1MiB, and since the
   simulated instructions must itself be a user instructions in the
   TTBR0 address range, these can address the final 1MiB of the TTBR1
   acddress range by wrapping downwards from an address in the first
   1MiB of the TTBR0 address range.

   In contemporary kernels the last 8MiB of TTBR1 address range is
   reserved, and accesses to this will always fault, meaning this is no
   worse than (1).

   Historically, it was theoretically possible for the linear map or
   vmemmap to spill into the final 8MiB of the TTBR1 address range, but
   in practice this is extremely unlikely to occur as this would
   require either:

   * Having enough physical memory to fill the entire linear map all the
     way to the final 1MiB of the TTBR1 address range.

   * Getting unlucky with KASLR randomization of the linear map such
     that the populated region happens to overlap with the last 1MiB of
     the TTBR address range.

   ... and in either case if we were to spill into the final page there
   would be larger problems as the final page would alias with error
   pointers.

Practically speaking, (1) and (2) are the big issues. Given there have
been no reports of problems since the broken code was introduced, it
appears that no-one is relying on probing these instructions with
uprobes.

Avoid these issues by not allowing uprobes on LDR (literal) and LDRSW
(literal), limiting the use of simulate_ldr_literal() and
simulate_ldrsw_literal() to kprobes. Attempts to place uprobes on LDR
(literal) and LDRSW (literal) will be rejected as
arm_probe_decode_insn() will return INSN_REJECTED. In future we can
consider introducing working uprobes support for these instructions, but
this will require more significant work.",'-,5.5,6021689,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7288-1),4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,231339923,ryder,"10.200.1.77,172.17.0.1,172.20.0.1","fe80:0:0:0:42:96ff:fe0f:3a59,fe80:0:0:0:42:c5ff:fec9:2551,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:da46,fe80:0:0:0:4034:56ff:fe5b:9bca,fe80:0:0:0:40a7:6dff:fec7:2075,fe80:0:0:0:f868:12ff:fe5a:fc42",Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7288-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7288-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,30,5,"Feb 25, 2025","Feb 24, 2025",Ubuntu,HIGH,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 22.04.4,'-,'-,29,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,336,,"#table cols=""3""

This issue was also reported by syzbot.

It can be reproduced by following these steps(more details [1]):
1. Obtain more than 32 inputs that have similar hashes, which ends with the
   pattern '0xxxxxxxe6'.
2. Reboot and add the keys obtained in step 1.

The reproducer demonstrates how this issue happened:
1. In the search_nested_keyrings function, when it iterates through the
   slots in a node(below tag ascend_to_node), if the slot pointer is meta
   and node->back_pointer != NULL(it means a root), it will proceed to
   descend_to_node. However, there is an exception. If node is the root,
   and one of the slots points to a shortcut, it will be treated as a
   keyring.
2. Whether the ptr is keyring decided by keyring_ptr_is_keyring function.
   However, KEYRING_PTR_SUBTYPE is 0x2UL, the same as
   ASSOC_ARRAY_PTR_SUBTYPE_MASK.
3. When 32 keys with the similar hashes are added to the tree, the ROOT
   has keys with hashes that are not similar (e.g. slot 0) and it splits
   NODE A without using a shortcut. When NODE A is filled with keys that
   all hashes are xxe6, the keys are similar, NODE A will split with a
   shortcut. Finally, it forms the tree as shown below, where slot 6 points
   to a shortcut.

                      NODE A
              +------>+---+
      ROOT    |       | 0 | xxe6
      +---+   |       +---+
 xxxx | 0 | shortcut  :   : xxe6
      +---+   |       +---+
 xxe6 :   :   |       |   | xxe6
      +---+   |       +---+
      | 6 |---+       :   : xxe6
      +---+           +---+
 xxe6 :   :           | f | xxe6
      +---+           +---+
 xxe6 | f |
      +---+

4. As mentioned above, If a slot(slot 6) of the root points to a shortcut,
   it may be mistakenly transferred to a key*, leading to a read
   out-of-bounds read.

To fix this issue, one should jump to descend_to_node if the ptr is a
shortcut, regardless of whether the node is root or not.

CVE-2024-50141,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ACPI: PRM: Find EFI_MEMORY_RUNTIME block for PRM handler and context

PRMT needs to find the correct type of block to translate the PA-VA
mapping for EFI runtime services.

The issue arises because the PRMT is finding a block of type
EFI_CONVENTIONAL_MEMORY, which is not appropriate for runtime services
as described in Section 2.2.2 (Runtime Services) of the UEFI
Specification [1]. Since the PRM handler is a type of runtime service,
this causes an exception when the PRM handler is called.

    [Firmware Bug]: Unable to handle paging request in EFI runtime service
    WARNING: CPU: 22 PID: 4330 at drivers/firmware/efi/runtime-wrappers.c:341
        __efi_queue_work+0x11c/0x170
    Call trace:

Let PRMT find a block with EFI_MEMORY_RUNTIME for PRM handler and PRM
context.

If no suitable block is found, a warning message will be printed, but
the procedure continues to manage the next PRM handler.

However, if the PRM handler is actually called without proper allocation,
it would result in a failure during error handling.

By using the correct memory types for runtime services, ensure that the
PRM handler and the context are properly mapped in the virtual address
space during runtime, preventing the paging request error.

The issue is really that only memory that has been remapped for runtime
by the firmware can be used by the PRM handler, and so the region needs
to have the EFI_MEMORY_RUNTIME attribute.

CVE-2024-50142,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

xfrm: validate new SA's prefixlen using SA family when sel.family is unset

This expands the validation introduced in commit 07bf7908950a (""xfrm:
Validate address prefix lengths in the xfrm selector."")

syzbot created an SA with
    usersa.sel.family = AF_UNSPEC
    usersa.sel.prefixlen_s = 128
    usersa.family = AF_INET

Because of the AF_UNSPEC selector, verify_newsa_info doesn't put
limits on prefixlen_{s,d}. But then copy_from_user_state sets

So rq_qos_wake_function() calls wake_up_process(data->task), which calls
try_to_wake_up(), which faults in raw_spin_lock_irqsave(&p->pi_lock).

p comes from data->task, and data comes from the waitqueue entry, which
is stored on the waiter's stack in rq_qos_wait(). Analyzing the core
dump with drgn, I found that the waiter had already woken up and moved
on to a completely unrelated code path, clobbering what was previously
data->task. Meanwhile, the waker was passing the clobbered garbage in
data->task to wake_up_process(), leading to the crash.

What's happening is that in between rq_qos_wake_function() deleting the
waitqueue entry and calling wake_up_process(), rq_qos_wait() is finding
that it already got a token and returning. The race looks like this:

rq_qos_wait()                           rq_qos_wake_function()
==============================================================
prepare_to_wait_exclusive()
                                        data->got_token = true;
                                        list_del_init(&curr->entry);
if (data.got_token)
        break;
finish_wait(&rqw->wait, &data.wq);
  ^- returns immediately because
     list_empty_careful(&wq_entry->entry)
     is true
... return, go do something else ...
                                        wake_up_process(data->task)
                                          (NO LONGER VALID!)-^

Normally, finish_wait() is supposed to synchronize against the waker.
But, as noted above, it is returning immediately because the waitqueue
entry has already been removed from the waitqueue.

The bug is that rq_qos_wake_function() is accessing the waitqueue entry
AFTER deleting it. Note that autoremove_wake_function() wakes the waiter
and THEN deletes the waitqueue entry, which is the proper order.

Fix it by swapping the order. We also need to use
list_del_init_careful() to match the list_empty_careful() in
finish_wait().",'-,4.7,6021689,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7288-1),4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,231339923,ryder,"10.200.1.77,172.17.0.1,172.20.0.1","fe80:0:0:0:42:96ff:fe0f:3a59,fe80:0:0:0:42:c5ff:fec9:2551,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:da46,fe80:0:0:0:4034:56ff:fe5b:9bca,fe80:0:0:0:40a7:6dff:fec7:2075,fe80:0:0:0:f868:12ff:fe5a:fc42",Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7288-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7288-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,30,5,"Feb 25, 2025","Feb 24, 2025",Ubuntu,HIGH,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 22.04.4,'-,'-,29,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,336,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-40953,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: Fix a data race on last_boosted_vcpu in kvm_vcpu_on_spin()

Use {READ,WRITE}_ONCE() to access kvm->last_boosted_vcpu to ensure the
loads and stores are atomic.  In the extremely unlikely scenario the
compiler tears the stores, it's theoretically possible for KVM to attempt
to get a vCPU using an out-of-bounds index, e.g. if the write is split
into multiple 8-bit stores, and is paired with a 32-bit load on a VM with
257 vCPUs:

  CPU0                              CPU1
  last_boosted_vcpu = 0xff;

                                    (last_boosted_vcpu = 0x100)
                                    last_boosted_vcpu[15:8] = 0x01;
  i = (last_boosted_vcpu = 0x1ff)
                                    last_boosted_vcpu[7:0] = 0x00;

CVE-2024-50115,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: nSVM: Ignore nCR3[4:0] when loading PDPTEs from memory

Ignore nCR3[4:0] when loading PDPTEs from memory for nested SVM, as bits
4:0 of CR3 are ignored when PAE paging is used, and thus VMRUN doesn't
enforce 32-byte alignment of nCR3.

In the absolute worst case scenario, failure to ignore bits 4:0 can result
in an out-of-bounds read, e.g. if the target page is at the end of a
memslot, and the VMM isn't using guard pages.

Per the APM:

  The CR3 register points to the base address of the page-directory-pointer
  table. The page-directory-pointer table is aligned on a 32-byte boundary,
  with the low 5 address bits 4:0 assumed to be 0.

And the SDM's much more explicit:

  4:0    Ignored

Note, KVM gets this right when loading PDPTRs, it's only the nSVM flow
that is broken.",'-,7.1,6021689,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7288-1),4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,231339923,ryder,"10.200.1.77,172.17.0.1,172.20.0.1","fe80:0:0:0:42:96ff:fe0f:3a59,fe80:0:0:0:42:c5ff:fec9:2551,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:da46,fe80:0:0:0:4034:56ff:fe5b:9bca,fe80:0:0:0:40a7:6dff:fec7:2075,fe80:0:0:0:f868:12ff:fe5a:fc42",Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7288-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7288-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,35,5,"Feb 25, 2025","Feb 24, 2025",Ubuntu,HIGH,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 22.04.4,'-,'-,29,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,336,,"#table cols=""3""

the interrupt handler) trying to bring things down. Eventually
the whole thing blows up.

CVE-2024-50195,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

posix-clock: Fix missing timespec64 check in pc_clock_settime()

As Andrew pointed out, it will make sense that the PTP core
checked timespec64 struct's tv_sec and tv_nsec range before calling
ptp->info->settime64().

As the man manual of clock_settime() said, if tp.tv_sec is negative or
tp.tv_nsec is outside the range [0..999,999,999], it should return EINVAL,
which include dynamic clocks which handles PTP clock, and the condition is
consistent with timespec64_valid(). As Thomas suggested, timespec64_valid()
only check the timespec is valid, but not ensure that the time is
in a valid range, so check it ahead using timespec64_valid_strict()
in pc_clock_settime() and return -EINVAL if not valid.

There are some drivers that use tp->tv_sec and tp->tv_nsec directly to
write registers without validity checks and assume that the higher layer
has checked it, which is dangerous and will benefit from this, such as
hclge_ptp_settime(), igb_ptp_settime_i210(), _rcar_gen4_ptp_settime(),

CVE-2024-50196,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

pinctrl: ocelot: fix system hang on level based interrupts

The current implementation only calls chained_irq_enter() and
chained_irq_exit() if it detects pending interrupts.

```
for (i = 0; i < info->stride; i++) {
	uregmap_read(info->map, id_reg + 4 * i, &reg);
	if (!reg)
		continue;

	chained_irq_enter(parent_chip, desc);
```

However, in case of GPIO pin configured in level mode and the parent
controller configured in edge mode, GPIO interrupt might be lowered by the
hardware. In the result, if the interrupt is short enough, the parent
interrupt is still pending while the GPIO interrupt is cleared;
chained_irq_enter() never gets called and the system hangs trying to
service the parent interrupt.

Moving chained_irq_enter() and chained_irq_exit() outside the for loop
ensures that they are called even when GPIO interrupt is lowered by the
hardware.

The similar code with chained_irq_enter() / chained_irq_exit() functions
wrapping interrupt checking loop may be found in many other drivers:

grep -r -A 10 chained_irq_enter drivers/pinctrl

filesystem corruption and degrades to read-only,

fail the BUG_ON check for accesses exceeding the folio/page size,
triggering a kernel bug.

This was found to be because the ""checked"" flag of a page/folio was not
cleared when it was discarded by nilfs2's own routine, which causes the
sanity check of directory entries to be skipped when the directory

CVE-2024-26718,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dm-crypt, dm-verity: disable tasklets

Tasklets have an inherent problem with memory corruption. The function
tasklet_action_common calls tasklet_trylock, then it calls the tasklet
callback and then it calls tasklet_unlock. If the tasklet callback frees
the structure that contains the tasklet or if it calls some code that may
free it, tasklet_unlock will write into free memory.

The commits 8e14f610159d and d9a02e016aaf try to fix it for dm-crypt, but
it is not a sufficient fix and the data corruption can still happen [1].
There is no fix for dm-verity and dm-verity will write into free memory
with every tasklet-processed bio.

There will be atomic workqueues implemented in the kernel 6.9 [2]. They
will have better interface and they will not suffer from the memory
corruption problem.

But we need something that stops the memory corruption now and that can be
backported to the stable kernels. So, I'm proposing this commit that
disables tasklets in both dm-crypt and dm-verity. This commit doesn't
remove the tasklet support, because the tasklet code will be reused when

CVE-2025-0714,"The vulnerability exists in the password storage of Mobateks MobaXterm in versions below 25.0. MobaXTerm uses an initialisation vector (IV) consisting only of zero bytes and a master key to encrypt each password individually.

CVE-2024-41066,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ibmvnic: Add tx check to prevent skb leak

Below is a summary of how the driver stores a reference to an skb during
transmit:
    tx_buff[free_map[consumer_index]]->skb = new_skb;
    free_map[consumer_index] = IBMVNIC_INVALID_MAP;
    consumer_index ++;
Where variable data looks like this:
    free_map == [4, IBMVNIC_INVALID_MAP, IBMVNIC_INVALID_MAP, 0, 3]
                                               	consumer_index^
    tx_buff == [skb=null, skb=<ptr>, skb=<ptr>, skb=null, skb=null]

The driver has checks to ensure that free_map[consumer_index] pointed to
a valid index but there was no check to ensure that this index pointed
to an unused/null skb address. So, if, by some chance, our free_map and
tx_buff lists become out of sync then we were previously risking an
skb memory leak. This could then cause tcp congestion control to stop
sending packets, eventually leading to ETIMEDOUT.

Therefore, add a conditional to ensure that the skb address is null. If
not then warn the user (because this is still a bug that should be
patched) and free the old pointer to prevent memleak/tcp problems.",'-,5.5,6021727,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7293-1),5,5,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 27, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,223994195,ptdtc-sv-klmsq1.portugal.pt,"10.200.4.150,172.17.0.1",fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:87d7,Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7293-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7293-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,30,4,"Feb 26, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",Ubuntu,CRITICAL,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 20.04.6,'-,'-,25,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,331,,"#table cols=""3""

In the commit aee2424246f9 (""RDMA/iwcm: Fix a use-after-free related to

work queue iwcm_wq.

But at that time, the work queue iwcm_wq was created via the function
alloc_ordered_workqueue without the flag WQ_MEM_RECLAIM.

Because the current process is trying to flush the whole iwcm_wq, if
iwcm_wq doesn't have the flag WQ_MEM_RECLAIM, verify that the current
process is not reclaiming memory or running on a workqueue which doesn't
have the flag WQ_MEM_RECLAIM as that can break forward-progress guarantee
leading to a deadlock.

CVE-2024-49867,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: wait for fixup workers before stopping cleaner kthread during umount

During unmount, at close_ctree(), we have the following steps in this order:

1) Park the cleaner kthread - this doesn't destroy the kthread, it basically
   halts its execution (wake ups against it work but do nothing);

2) We stop the cleaner kthread - this results in freeing the respective
   struct task_struct;

3) We call btrfs_stop_all_workers() which waits for any jobs running in all
   the work queues and then free the work queues.

Syzbot reported a case where a fixup worker resulted in a crash when doing
a delayed iput on its inode while attempting to wake up the cleaner at
btrfs_add_delayed_iput(), because the task_struct of the cleaner kthread
was already freed. This can happen during unmount because we don't wait
for any fixup workers still running before we call kthread_stop() against
the cleaner kthread, which stops and free all its resources.

Fix this by waiting for any fixup workers at close_ctree() before we call
kthread_stop() against the cleaner and run pending delayed iputs.

The stack traces reported by syzbot were the following:

[CAUSE]
The allocation failure happens at the start_transaction() inside
prepare_to_relocate(), and during the error handling we call
unset_reloc_control(), which makes fs_info->balance_ctl to be NULL.

Then we continue the error path cleanup in btrfs_balance() by calling
reset_balance_state() which will call del_balance_item() to fully delete
the balance item in the root tree.

However during the small window between set_reloc_contrl() and
unset_reloc_control(), we can have a subvolume tree update and created a
reloc_root for that subvolume.

Then we go into the final btrfs_commit_transaction() of
del_balance_item(), and into btrfs_update_reloc_root() inside
commit_fs_roots().

That function checks if fs_info->reloc_ctl is in the merge_reloc_tree
stage, but since fs_info->reloc_ctl is NULL, it results a NULL pointer
dereference.

[FIX]
Just add extra check on fs_info->reloc_ctl inside
btrfs_update_reloc_root(), before checking
fs_info->reloc_ctl->merge_reloc_tree.

That DEAD_RELOC_TREE handling is to prevent further modification to the
reloc tree during merge stage, but since there is no reloc_ctl at all,
we do not need to bother that.",'-,5.5,6021727,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7293-1),5,5,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 27, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,223994195,ptdtc-sv-klmsq1.portugal.pt,"10.200.4.150,172.17.0.1",fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:87d7,Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7293-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7293-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,30,4,"Feb 26, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",Ubuntu,CRITICAL,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 20.04.6,'-,'-,25,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,331,,"#table cols=""3""

The root cause is that, in lookup_rec(), ftrace record of some address
is being searched in ftrace pages of some module, but those ftrace pages
at the same time is being freed in ftrace_release_mod() as the
corresponding module is being deleted:

           CPU1                       |      CPU2

        ftrace_location() {           |
          lookup_rec() // USE!        |   ftrace_release_mod() // Free!

To fix this issue:
  1. Hold rcu lock as accessing ftrace pages in ftrace_location_range();
  2. Use ftrace_location_range() instead of lookup_rec() in
     ftrace_location();
  3. Call synchronize_rcu() before freeing any ftrace pages both in
     ftrace_process_locs()/ftrace_release_mod()/ftrace_free_mem().",'-,7.8,6021727,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7293-1),5,5,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 27, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,223994195,ptdtc-sv-klmsq1.portugal.pt,"10.200.4.150,172.17.0.1",fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:87d7,Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7293-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7293-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,35,4,"Feb 26, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",Ubuntu,CRITICAL,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 20.04.6,'-,'-,25,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,331,,"#table cols=""3""

net: hns3: fix kernel crash when uninstalling driver

When the driver is uninstalled and the VF is disabled concurrently, a
kernel crash occurs. The reason is that the two actions call function
pci_disable_sriov(). The num_VFs is checked to determine whether to
release the corresponding resources. During the second calling, num_VFs
is not 0 and the resource release function is called. However, the
corresponding resource has been released during the first invoking.

media: dvbdev: prevent the risk of out of memory access

The dvbdev contains a static variable used to store dvb minors.

The behavior of it depends if CONFIG_DVB_DYNAMIC_MINORS is set
or not. When not set, dvb_register_device() won't check for
boundaries, as it will rely that a previous call to
dvb_register_adapter() would already be enforcing it.

On a similar way, dvb_device_open() uses the assumption
that the register functions already did the needed checks.

This can be fragile if some device ends using different
calls. This also generate warnings on static check analysers
like Coverity.

Currently we have a global spi_add_lock which we take when adding new

itself a SPI controller and triggers the instantiation of further SPI
devices we trigger a deadlock as we try to register and instantiate
those devices while in the process of doing so for the parent controller
and hence already holding the global spi_add_lock.  Since we only care
about concurrency within a single SPI bus move the lock to be per

CVE-2024-50194,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64: probes: Fix uprobes for big-endian kernels

The arm64 uprobes code is broken for big-endian kernels as it doesn't
convert the in-memory instruction encoding (which is always
little-endian) into the kernel's native endianness before analyzing and
simulating instructions. This may result in a few distinct problems:

* The kernel may may erroneously reject probing an instruction which can
  safely be probed.

* The kernel may erroneously erroneously permit stepping an
  instruction out-of-line when that instruction cannot be stepped
  out-of-line safely.

* The kernel may erroneously simulate instruction incorrectly dur to
  interpretting the byte-swapped encoding.

The endianness mismatch isn't caught by the compiler or sparse because:

* The arch_uprobe::{insn,ixol} fields are encoded as arrays of u8, so
  the compiler and sparse have no idea these contain a little-endian
  32-bit value. The core uprobes code populates these with a memcpy()
  which similarly does not handle endianness.

* While the uprobe_opcode_t type is an alias for __le32, both
  arch_uprobe_analyze_insn() and arch_uprobe_skip_sstep() cast from u8[]
  to the similarly-named probe_opcode_t, which is an alias for u32.
  Hence there is no endianness conversion warning.

Fix this by changing the arch_uprobe::{insn,ixol} fields to __le32 and
adding the appropriate __le32_to_cpu() conversions prior to consuming
the instruction encoding. The core uprobes copies these fields as opaque
ranges of bytes, and so is unaffected by this change.

At the same time, remove MAX_UINSN_BYTES and consistently use
AARCH64_INSN_SIZE for clarity.

Tested with the following:

| #include <stdio.h>
| #include <stdbool.h>
|
| #define noinline __attribute__((noinline))
|
| static noinline void *adrp_self(void)
| {
|         void *addr;

| }
|
|
| int main(int argc, char *argv)

.... where the adrp_self() function was compiled to:

| 00000000004007e0 <adrp_self>:

|   4007e8:       d65f03c0        ret

Before this patch, the ADRP is not recognized, and is assumed to be
steppable, resulting in corruption of the result:

| # ./adrp-self

CVE-2024-47740,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

f2fs: Require FMODE_WRITE for atomic write ioctls

The F2FS ioctls for starting and committing atomic writes check for
inode_owner_or_capable(), but this does not give LSMs like SELinux or
Landlock an opportunity to deny the write access - if the caller's FSUID
matches the inode's UID, inode_owner_or_capable() immediately returns true.

There are scenarios where LSMs want to deny a process the ability to write
particular files, even files that the FSUID of the process owns; but this
can currently partially be bypassed using atomic write ioctls in two ways:

 - F2FS_IOC_START_ATOMIC_REPLACE + F2FS_IOC_COMMIT_ATOMIC_WRITE can
   truncate an inode to size 0
 - F2FS_IOC_START_ATOMIC_WRITE + F2FS_IOC_ABORT_ATOMIC_WRITE can revert
   changes another process concurrently made to a file

Fix it by requiring FMODE_WRITE for these operations, just like for
F2FS_IOC_MOVE_RANGE. Since any legitimate caller should only be using these
ioctls when intending to write into the file, that seems unlikely to break
anything.",'-,'-,6021727,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7293-1),5,5,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 27, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,223994195,ptdtc-sv-klmsq1.portugal.pt,"10.200.4.150,172.17.0.1",fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:87d7,Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7293-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7293-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,'-,4,"Feb 26, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",Ubuntu,CRITICAL,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 20.04.6,'-,'-,25,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,331,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-47699,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nilfs2: fix potential null-ptr-deref in nilfs_btree_insert()

Patch series ""nilfs2: fix potential issues with empty b-tree nodes"".

This series addresses three potential issues with empty b-tree nodes that
can occur with corrupted filesystem images, including one recently
discovered by syzbot.


This patch (of 3):

If a b-tree is broken on the device, and the b-tree height is greater than
2 (the level of the root node is greater than 1) even if the number of
child nodes of the b-tree root is 0, a NULL pointer dereference occurs in
nilfs_btree_prepare_insert(), which is called from nilfs_btree_insert().

This is because, when the number of child nodes of the b-tree root is 0,
nilfs_btree_do_lookup() does not set the block buffer head in any of
path[x].bp_bh, leaving it as the initial value of NULL, but if the level
of the b-tree root node is greater than 1, nilfs_btree_get_nonroot_node(),
which accesses the buffer memory of path[x].bp_bh, is called.

Fix this issue by adding a check to nilfs_btree_root_broken(), which
performs sanity checks when reading the root node from the device, to
detect this inconsistency.

CVE-2024-49878,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

resource: fix region_intersects() vs add_memory_driver_managed()

On a system with CXL memory, the resource tree (/proc/iomem) related to
CXL memory may look like something as follows.

490000000-50fffffff : CXL Window 0
  490000000-50fffffff : region0
    490000000-50fffffff : dax0.0
      490000000-50fffffff : System RAM (kmem)

Because drivers/dax/kmem.c calls add_memory_driver_managed() during
onlining CXL memory, which makes ""System RAM (kmem)"" a descendant of ""CXL
Window X"".  This confuses region_intersects(), which expects all ""System
RAM"" resources to be at the top level of iomem_resource.  This can lead to
bugs.

For example, when the following command line is executed to write some
memory in CXL memory range via /dev/mem,

 $ dd if=data of=/dev/mem bs=$((1 << 10)) seek=$((0x490000000 >> 10)) count=1
 dd: error writing '/dev/mem': Bad address
 1+0 records in
 0+0 records out
 0 bytes copied, 0.0283507 s, 0.0 kB/s

the command fails as expected.  However, the error code is wrong.  It
should be ""Operation not permitted"" instead of ""Bad address"".  More
seriously, the /dev/mem permission checking in devmem_is_allowed() passes
incorrectly.  Although the accessing is prevented later because ioremap()
isn't allowed to map system RAM, it is a potential security issue.  During
command executing, the following warning is reported in the kernel log for
calling ioremap() on system RAM.

 ioremap on RAM at 0x0000000490000000 - 0x0000000490000fff
 WARNING: CPU: 2 PID: 416 at arch/x86/mm/ioremap.c:216 __ioremap_caller.constprop.0+0x131/0x35d

  entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x4b/0x53

The details of command execution process are as follows.  In the above
resource tree, ""System RAM"" is a descendant of ""CXL Window 0"" instead of a
top level resource.  So, region_intersects() will report no System RAM
resources in the CXL memory region incorrectly, because it only checks the
top level resources.  Consequently, devmem_is_allowed() will return 1
(allow access via /dev/mem) for CXL memory region incorrectly. 
Fortunately, ioremap() doesn't allow to map System RAM and reject the
access.

So, region_intersects() needs to be fixed to work correctly with the
resource tree with ""System RAM"" not at top level as above.  To fix it, if
we found a unmatched resource in the top level, we will continue to search
matched resources in its descendant resources.  So, we will not miss any
matched resources in resource tree anymore.

In the new implementation, an example resource tree

|------------- ""CXL Window 0"" ------------|
|-- ""System RAM"" --|

will behave similar as the following fake resource tree for
region_intersects(, IORESOURCE_SYSTEM_RAM, ),

|-- ""System RAM"" --||-- ""CXL Window 0a"" --|

Where ""CXL Window 0a"" is part of the original ""CXL Window 0"" that
isn't covered by ""System RAM"".",'-,5.5,6021727,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7293-1),5,5,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 27, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,223994195,ptdtc-sv-klmsq1.portugal.pt,"10.200.4.150,172.17.0.1",fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:87d7,Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7293-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7293-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,30,4,"Feb 26, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",Ubuntu,CRITICAL,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 20.04.6,'-,'-,25,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,331,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-50229,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nilfs2: fix potential deadlock with newly created symlinks

Syzbot reported that page_symlink(), called by nilfs_symlink(), triggers
memory reclamation involving the filesystem layer, which can result in
circular lock dependencies among the reader/writer semaphore
nilfs->ns_segctor_sem, s_writers percpu_rwsem (intwrite) and the
fs_reclaim pseudo lock.

This is because after commit 21fc61c73c39 (""don't put symlink bodies in
pagecache into highmem""), the gfp flags of the page cache for symbolic
links are overwritten to GFP_KERNEL via inode_nohighmem().

This is not a problem for symlinks read from the backing device, because
the __GFP_FS flag is dropped after inode_nohighmem() is called.  However,
when a new symlink is created with nilfs_symlink(), the gfp flags remain
overwritten to GFP_KERNEL.  Then, memory allocation called from
page_symlink() etc.  triggers memory reclamation including the FS layer,
which may call nilfs_evict_inode() or nilfs_dirty_inode().  And these can
cause a deadlock if they are called while nilfs->ns_segctor_sem is held:

Fix this issue by dropping the __GFP_FS flag from the page cache GFP flags
of newly created symlinks in the same way that nilfs_new_inode() and
__nilfs_read_inode() do, as a workaround until we adopt nofs allocation
scope consistently or improve the locking constraints.",'-,5.5,6021727,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7293-1),5,5,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 27, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,223994195,ptdtc-sv-klmsq1.portugal.pt,"10.200.4.150,172.17.0.1",fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:87d7,Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7293-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7293-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,30,4,"Feb 26, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",Ubuntu,CRITICAL,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 20.04.6,'-,'-,25,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,331,,"#table cols=""3""

drm/vmwgfx: Fix a deadlock in dma buf fence polling

Introduce a version of the fence ops that on release doesn't remove
the fence from the pending list, and thus doesn't require a lock to
fix poll->fence wait->fence unref deadlocks.

vmwgfx overwrites the wait callback to iterate over the list of all
fences and update their status, to do that it holds a lock to prevent
the list modifcations from other threads. The fence destroy callback
both deletes the fence and removes it from the list of pending
fences, for which it holds a lock.

dma buf polling cb unrefs a fence after it's been signaled: so the poll
calls the wait, which signals the fences, which are being destroyed.
The destruction tries to acquire the lock on the pending fences list
which it can never get because it's held by the wait from which it
was called.

There is a WARNING in iwl_trans_wait_tx_queues_empty() (that was

wait for TX queues to become empty after firmware died. Clearly,
we can't expect anything from the firmware after it's declared dead.

be a good idea to stop the flow earlier, the flush functions do some

mm: avoid leaving partial pfn mappings around in error case

As Jann points out, PFN mappings are special, because unlike normal
memory mappings, there is no lifetime information associated with the
mapping - it is just a raw mapping of PFNs with no reference counting of
a 'struct page'.

That's all very much intentional, but it does mean that it's easy to
mess up the cleanup in case of errors.  Yes, a failed mmap() will always
eventually clean up any partial mappings, but without any explicit
lifetime in the page table mapping itself, it's very easy to do the
error handling in the wrong order.

In particular, it's easy to mistakenly free the physical backing store
before the page tables are actually cleaned up and (temporarily) have
stale dangling PTE entries.

To make this situation less error-prone, just make sure that any partial
pfn mapping is torn down early, before any other error handling.",'-,5.5,6021727,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7293-1),5,5,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 27, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,223994195,ptdtc-sv-klmsq1.portugal.pt,"10.200.4.150,172.17.0.1",fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:87d7,Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7293-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7293-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,37,4,"Feb 26, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",Ubuntu,CRITICAL,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 20.04.6,'-,'-,25,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,331,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-50039,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/sched: accept TCA_STAB only for root qdisc

Most qdiscs maintain their backlog using qdisc_pkt_len(skb)
on the assumption it is invariant between the enqueue()
and dequeue() handlers.

Unfortunately syzbot can crash a host rather easily using
a TBF + SFQ combination, with an STAB on SFQ [1]

We can't support TCA_STAB on arbitrary level, this would
require to maintain per-qdisc storage.

CVE-2024-47706,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

block, bfq: fix possible UAF for bfqq->bic with merge chain

1) initial state, three tasks:

		Process 1       Process 2	Process 3
		 (BIC1)          (BIC2)		 (BIC3)
		  |  ?            |  ?		  |  ?
		  |  |            |  |		  |  |
		  V  |            V  |		  V  |
		  bfqq1           bfqq2		  bfqq3
process ref:	   1		    1		    1

2) bfqq1 merged to bfqq2:

		Process 1       Process 2	Process 3
		 (BIC1)          (BIC2)		 (BIC3)
		  |               |		  |  ?
		  \--------------\|		  |  |
		                  V		  V  |
		  bfqq1--------->bfqq2		  bfqq3
process ref:	   0		    2		    1

3) bfqq2 merged to bfqq3:

		Process 1       Process 2	Process 3
		 (BIC1)          (BIC2)		 (BIC3)
	 here -> ?                |		  |
		  \--------------\ \-------------\|
		                  V		  V
		  bfqq1--------->bfqq2---------->bfqq3
process ref:	   0		    1		    3

In this case, IO from Process 1 will get bfqq2 from BIC1 first, and then
get bfqq3 through merge chain, and finially handle IO by bfqq3.
Howerver, current code will think bfqq2 is owned by BIC1, like initial
state, and set bfqq2->bic to BIC1.

bfq_insert_request
-> by Process 1
 bfqq = bfq_init_rq(rq)
  bfqq = bfq_get_bfqq_handle_split
   bfqq = bic_to_bfqq
   -> get bfqq2 from BIC1
 bfqq->ref++
 rq->elv.priv[0] = bic
 rq->elv.priv[1] = bfqq
 if (bfqq_process_refs(bfqq) == 1)
  bfqq->bic = bic
  -> record BIC1 to bfqq2

  __bfq_insert_request
   new_bfqq = bfq_setup_cooperator
   -> get bfqq3 from bfqq2->new_bfqq
   bfqq_request_freed(bfqq)
   new_bfqq->ref++
   rq->elv.priv[1] = new_bfqq
   -> handle IO by bfqq3

Fix the problem by checking bfqq is from merge chain fist. And this
might fix a following problem reported by our syzkaller(unreproducible):

CVE-2024-50278,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dm cache: fix potential out-of-bounds access on the first resume

Out-of-bounds access occurs if the fast device is expanded unexpectedly
before the first-time resume of the cache table. This happens because
expanding the fast device requires reloading the cache table for
cache_create to allocate new in-core data structures that fit the new
size, and the check in cache_preresume is not performed during the
first resume, leading to the issue.

Reproduce steps:

1. prepare component devices:

dmsetup create cmeta --table ""0 8192 linear /dev/sdc 0""
dmsetup create cdata --table ""0 65536 linear /dev/sdc 8192""
dmsetup create corig --table ""0 524288 linear /dev/sdc 262144""
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/mapper/cmeta bs=4k count=1 oflag=direct

2. load a cache table of 512 cache blocks, and deliberately expand the
   fast device before resuming the cache, making the in-core data
   structures inadequate.

dmsetup create cache --notable
dmsetup reload cache --table ""0 524288 cache /dev/mapper/cmeta \
/dev/mapper/cdata /dev/mapper/corig 128 2 metadata2 writethrough smq 0""
dmsetup reload cdata --table ""0 131072 linear /dev/sdc 8192""
dmsetup resume cdata
dmsetup resume cache

3. suspend the cache to write out the in-core dirty bitset and hint
   array, leading to out-of-bounds access to the dirty bitset at offset
   0x40:

dmsetup suspend cache

CVE-2024-47709,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

can: bcm: Clear bo->bcm_proc_read after remove_proc_entry().

syzbot reported a warning in bcm_release(). [0]

The blamed change fixed another warning that is triggered when
connect() is issued again for a socket whose connect()ed device has
been unregistered.

However, if the socket is just close()d without the 2nd connect(), the
remaining bo->bcm_proc_read triggers unnecessary remove_proc_entry()
in bcm_release().

Let's clear bo->bcm_proc_read after remove_proc_entry() in bcm_notify().

CVE-2024-50279,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dm cache: fix out-of-bounds access to the dirty bitset when resizing

dm-cache checks the dirty bits of the cache blocks to be dropped when
shrinking the fast device, but an index bug in bitset iteration causes
out-of-bounds access.

Reproduce steps:

1. create a cache device of 1024 cache blocks (128 bytes dirty bitset)

dmsetup create cmeta --table ""0 8192 linear /dev/sdc 0""
dmsetup create cdata --table ""0 131072 linear /dev/sdc 8192""
dmsetup create corig --table ""0 524288 linear /dev/sdc 262144""
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/mapper/cmeta bs=4k count=1 oflag=direct
dmsetup create cache --table ""0 524288 cache /dev/mapper/cmeta \
/dev/mapper/cdata /dev/mapper/corig 128 2 metadata2 writethrough smq 0""

2. shrink the fast device to 512 cache blocks, triggering out-of-bounds
   access to the dirty bitset (offset 0x80)

dmsetup suspend cache
dmsetup reload cdata --table ""0 65536 linear /dev/sdc 8192""
dmsetup resume cdata
dmsetup resume cache

smb: client: fix OOBs when building SMB2_IOCTL request

When using encryption, either enforced by the server or when using

CVE-2024-50273,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: reinitialize delayed ref list after deleting it from the list

At insert_delayed_ref() if we need to update the action of an existing
ref to BTRFS_DROP_DELAYED_REF, we delete the ref from its ref head's
ref_add_list using list_del(), which leaves the ref's add_list member
not reinitialized, as list_del() sets the next and prev members of the
list to LIST_POISON1 and LIST_POISON2, respectively.

If later we end up calling drop_delayed_ref() against the ref, which can
happen during merging or when destroying delayed refs due to a transaction
abort, we can trigger a crash since at drop_delayed_ref() we call
list_empty() against the ref's add_list, which returns false since
the list was not reinitialized after the list_del() and as a consequence
we call list_del() again at drop_delayed_ref(). This results in an
invalid list access since the next and prev members are set to poison
pointers, resulting in a splat if CONFIG_LIST_HARDENED and
CONFIG_DEBUG_LIST are set or invalid poison pointer dereferences
otherwise.

So fix this by deleting from the list with list_del_init() instead.",'-,5.5,6021727,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7293-1),5,5,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 27, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,223994195,ptdtc-sv-klmsq1.portugal.pt,"10.200.4.150,172.17.0.1",fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:87d7,Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7293-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7293-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,'-,4,"Feb 26, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",Ubuntu,CRITICAL,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 20.04.6,'-,'-,25,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,331,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-47684,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tcp: check skb is non-NULL in tcp_rto_delta_us()

We have some machines running stock Ubuntu 20.04.6 which is their 5.4.0-174-generic
kernel that are running ceph and recently hit a null ptr dereference in
tcp_rearm_rto(). Initially hitting it from the TLP path, but then later we also
saw it getting hit from the RACK case as well. Here are examples of the oops

CVE-2024-49985,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

i2c: stm32f7: Do not prepare/unprepare clock during runtime suspend/resume

In case there is any sort of clock controller attached to this I2C bus
controller, for example Versaclock or even an AIC32x4 I2C codec, then
an I2C transfer triggered from the clock controller clk_ops .prepare
callback may trigger a deadlock on drivers/clk/clk.c prepare_lock mutex.

This is because the clock controller first grabs the prepare_lock mutex
and then performs the prepare operation, including its I2C access. The
I2C access resumes this I2C bus controller via .runtime_resume callback,
which calls clk_prepare_enable(), which attempts to grab the prepare_lock
mutex again and deadlocks.

Since the clock are already prepared since probe() and unprepared in
remove(), use simple clk_enable()/clk_disable() calls to enable and
disable the clock on runtime suspend and resume, to avoid hitting the
prepare_lock mutex.",'-,5.5,6021727,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7293-1),5,5,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 27, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,223994195,ptdtc-sv-klmsq1.portugal.pt,"10.200.4.150,172.17.0.1",fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:87d7,Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7293-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7293-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,30,4,"Feb 26, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",Ubuntu,CRITICAL,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 20.04.6,'-,'-,25,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,331,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-49982,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

aoe: fix the potential use-after-free problem in more places

For fixing CVE-2023-6270, f98364e92662 (""aoe: fix the potential
use-after-free problem in aoecmd_cfg_pkts"") makes tx() calling dev_put()
instead of doing in aoecmd_cfg_pkts(). It avoids that the tx() runs
into use-after-free.

Then Nicolai Stange found more places in aoe have potential use-after-free
problem with tx(). e.g. revalidate(), aoecmd_ata_rw(), resend(), probe()
and aoecmd_cfg_rsp(). Those functions also use aoenet_xmit() to push
packet to tx queue. So they should also use dev_hold() to increase the
refcnt of skb->dev.

On the other hand, moving dev_put() to tx() causes that the refcnt of
skb->dev be reduced to a negative value, because corresponding
dev_hold() are not called in revalidate(), aoecmd_ata_rw(), resend(),
probe(), and aoecmd_cfg_rsp().

In the `wilc_parse_join_bss_param` function, the TSF field of the `ies`
structure is accessed after the RCU read-side critical section is
unlocked. According to RCU usage rules, this is illegal. Reusing this
pointer can lead to unpredictable behavior, including accessing memory
that has been updated or causing use-after-free issues.

This possible bug was identified using a static analysis tool developed
by myself, specifically designed to detect RCU-related issues.

To address this, the TSF value is now stored in a local variable
`ies_tsf` before the RCU lock is released. The `param->tsf_lo` field is
then assigned using this local variable, ensuring that the TSF value is
safely accessed.",'-,5.5,6021727,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7293-1),5,5,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 27, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,223994195,ptdtc-sv-klmsq1.portugal.pt,"10.200.4.150,172.17.0.1",fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:87d7,Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7293-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7293-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,30,4,"Feb 26, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",Ubuntu,CRITICAL,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 20.04.6,'-,'-,25,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,331,,"#table cols=""3""

vfs: fix race between evice_inodes() and find_inode()&iput()

Hi, all

Recently I noticed a bug[1] in btrfs, after digged it into
and I believe it'a race in vfs.

Let's assume there's a inode (ie ino 261) with i_count 1 is
called by iput(), and there's a concurrent thread calling
generic_shutdown_super().

cpu0:                              cpu1:
iput() // i_count is 1
  ->spin_lock(inode)
  ->dec i_count to 0
  ->iput_final()                    generic_shutdown_super()
    ->__inode_add_lru()               ->evict_inodes()
      // cause some reason[2]           ->if (atomic_read(inode->i_count)) continue;
      // return before                  // inode 261 passed the above check
      // list_lru_add_obj()             // and then schedule out
   ->spin_unlock()
// note here: the inode 261
// was still at sb list and hash list,
// and I_FREEING|I_WILL_FREE was not been set

btrfs_iget()
  // after some function calls
  ->find_inode()
    // found the above inode 261
    ->spin_lock(inode)
   // check I_FREEING|I_WILL_FREE
   // and passed
      ->__iget()
    ->spin_unlock(inode)                // schedule back
                                        ->spin_lock(inode)
                                        // check (I_NEW|I_FREEING|I_WILL_FREE) flags,
                                        // passed and set I_FREEING
iput()                                  ->spin_unlock(inode)
  ->spin_lock(inode)			  ->evict()
  // dec i_count to 0
  ->iput_final()
    ->spin_unlock()
    ->evict()

Now, we have two threads simultaneously evicting
the same inode, which may trigger the BUG(inode->i_state & I_CLEAR)
statement both within clear_inode() and iput().

To fix the bug, recheck the inode->i_count after holding i_lock.
Because in the most scenarios, the first check is valid, and
the overhead of spin_lock() can be reduced.

If there is any misunderstanding, please let me know, thanks.

CVE-2024-50045,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: br_netfilter: fix panic with metadata_dst skb

Fix a kernel panic in the br_netfilter module when sending untagged
traffic via a VxLAN device.
This happens during the check for fragmentation in br_nf_dev_queue_xmit.

It is dependent on:
1) the br_netfilter module being loaded;
2) net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables set to 1;
3) a bridge with a VxLAN (single-vxlan-device) netdevice as a bridge port;
4) untagged frames with size higher than the VxLAN MTU forwarded/flooded

When forwarding the untagged packet to the VxLAN bridge port, before
the netfilter hooks are called, br_handle_egress_vlan_tunnel is called and
changes the skb_dst to the tunnel dst. The tunnel_dst is a metadata type
of dst, i.e., skb_valid_dst(skb) is false, and metadata->dst.dev is NULL.

Then in the br_netfilter hooks, in br_nf_dev_queue_xmit, there's a check
for frames that needs to be fragmented: frames with higher MTU than the
VxLAN device end up calling br_nf_ip_fragment, which in turns call
ip_skb_dst_mtu.

The ip_dst_mtu tries to use the skb_dst(skb) as if it was a valid dst
with valid dst->dev, thus the crash.

This case was never supported in the first place, so drop the packet
instead.

CVE-2024-50202,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nilfs2: propagate directory read errors from nilfs_find_entry()

Syzbot reported that a task hang occurs in vcs_open() during a fuzzing
test for nilfs2.

The root cause of this problem is that in nilfs_find_entry(), which
searches for directory entries, ignores errors when loading a directory
page/folio via nilfs_get_folio() fails.

If the filesystem images is corrupted, and the i_size of the directory
inode is large, and the directory page/folio is successfully read but
fails the sanity check, for example when it is zero-filled,
nilfs_check_folio() may continue to spit out error messages in bursts.

Fix this issue by propagating the error to the callers when loading a
page/folio fails in nilfs_find_entry().

In sctp_listen_start() invoked by sctp_inet_listen(), it should set the

Otherwise, next time when calling sctp_inet_listen(), if sctp_sk(sk)->reuse

be dereferenced as sk_state is LISTENING, which causes a crash as bind_hash

CVE-2024-49949,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: avoid potential underflow in qdisc_pkt_len_init() with UFO

After commit 7c6d2ecbda83 (""net: be more gentle about silly gso
requests coming from user"") virtio_net_hdr_to_skb() had sanity check
to detect malicious attempts from user space to cook a bad GSO packet.

Then commit cf9acc90c80ec (""net: virtio_net_hdr_to_skb: count
transport header in UFO"") while fixing one issue, allowed user space
to cook a GSO packet with the following characteristic :

IPv4 SKB_GSO_UDP, gso_size=3, skb->len = 28.

When this packet arrives in qdisc_pkt_len_init(), we end up
with hdr_len = 28 (IPv4 header + UDP header), matching skb->len

Then the following sets gso_segs to 0 :

gso_segs = DIV_ROUND_UP(skb->len - hdr_len,
                        shinfo->gso_size);

Then later we set qdisc_skb_cb(skb)->pkt_len to back to zero :/

qdisc_skb_cb(skb)->pkt_len += (gso_segs - 1) * hdr_len;

This leads to the following crash in fq_codel [1]

qdisc_pkt_len_init() is best effort, we only want an estimation
of the bytes sent on the wire, not crashing the kernel.

This patch is fixing this particular issue, a following one
adds more sanity checks for another potential bug.

CVE-2024-44931,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

gpio: prevent potential speculation leaks in gpio_device_get_desc()

Userspace may trigger a speculative read of an address outside the gpio
descriptor array.
Users can do that by calling gpio_ioctl() with an offset out of range.
Offset is copied from user and then used as an array index to get
the gpio descriptor without sanitization in gpio_device_get_desc().

This change ensures that the offset is sanitized by using
array_index_nospec() to mitigate any possibility of speculative
information leaks.

The `nouveau_dmem_copy_one` function ensures that the copy push command is
sent to the device firmware but does not track whether it was executed
successfully.

In the case of a copy error (e.g., firmware or hardware failure), the

CVE-2024-50099,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64: probes: Remove broken LDR (literal) uprobe support

The simulate_ldr_literal() and simulate_ldrsw_literal() functions are
unsafe to use for uprobes. Both functions were originally written for
use with kprobes, and access memory with plain C accesses. When uprobes
was added, these were reused unmodified even though they cannot safely
access user memory.

There are three key problems:

1) The plain C accesses do not have corresponding extable entries, and
   thus if they encounter a fault the kernel will treat these as
   unintentional accesses to user memory, resulting in a BUG() which
   will kill the kernel thread, and likely lead to further issues (e.g.
   lockup or panic()).

2) The plain C accesses are subject to HW PAN and SW PAN, and so when
   either is in use, any attempt to simulate an access to user memory
   will fault. Thus neither simulate_ldr_literal() nor
   simulate_ldrsw_literal() can do anything useful when simulating a
   user instruction on any system with HW PAN or SW PAN.

3) The plain C accesses are privileged, as they run in kernel context,
   and in practice can access a small range of kernel virtual addresses.
   The instructions they simulate have a range of +/-1MiB, and since the
   simulated instructions must itself be a user instructions in the
   TTBR0 address range, these can address the final 1MiB of the TTBR1
   acddress range by wrapping downwards from an address in the first
   1MiB of the TTBR0 address range.

   In contemporary kernels the last 8MiB of TTBR1 address range is
   reserved, and accesses to this will always fault, meaning this is no
   worse than (1).

   Historically, it was theoretically possible for the linear map or
   vmemmap to spill into the final 8MiB of the TTBR1 address range, but
   in practice this is extremely unlikely to occur as this would
   require either:

   * Having enough physical memory to fill the entire linear map all the
     way to the final 1MiB of the TTBR1 address range.

   * Getting unlucky with KASLR randomization of the linear map such
     that the populated region happens to overlap with the last 1MiB of
     the TTBR address range.

   ... and in either case if we were to spill into the final page there
   would be larger problems as the final page would alias with error
   pointers.

Practically speaking, (1) and (2) are the big issues. Given there have
been no reports of problems since the broken code was introduced, it
appears that no-one is relying on probing these instructions with
uprobes.

Avoid these issues by not allowing uprobes on LDR (literal) and LDRSW
(literal), limiting the use of simulate_ldr_literal() and
simulate_ldrsw_literal() to kprobes. Attempts to place uprobes on LDR
(literal) and LDRSW (literal) will be rejected as
arm_probe_decode_insn() will return INSN_REJECTED. In future we can
consider introducing working uprobes support for these instructions, but
this will require more significant work.",'-,5.5,6021727,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7293-1),5,5,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 27, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,223994195,ptdtc-sv-klmsq1.portugal.pt,"10.200.4.150,172.17.0.1",fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:87d7,Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7293-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7293-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,30,4,"Feb 26, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",Ubuntu,CRITICAL,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 20.04.6,'-,'-,25,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,331,,"#table cols=""3""

The issue was in the reflink workfow while reserving space for inline
xattr.  The problematic function is ocfs2_reflink_xattr_inline().  By the
time this function is called the reflink tree is already recreated at the
destination inode from the source inode.  At this point, this function
reserves space for inline xattrs at the destination inode without even
checking if there is space at the root metadata block.  It simply reduces
the l_count from 243 to 227 thereby making space of 256 bytes for inline
xattr whereas the inode already has extents beyond this index (in this
case up to 230), thereby causing corruption.

The fix for this is to reserve space for inline metadata at the destination
inode before the reflink tree gets recreated. The customer has verified the
fix.",'-,5.5,6021727,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7293-1),5,5,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 27, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,223994195,ptdtc-sv-klmsq1.portugal.pt,"10.200.4.150,172.17.0.1",fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:87d7,Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7293-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7293-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,30,4,"Feb 26, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",Ubuntu,CRITICAL,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 20.04.6,'-,'-,25,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,331,,"#table cols=""3""

In this case the comment mentions that we can return 0 if
ocfs2_xa_cleanup_value_truncate() is going to wipe the entry
anyway. But the following 'rc' check is wrong and execution flow do
'ocfs2_xa_remove_entry(loc);' twice:

* 2nd: returning back to ocfs2_xa_remove() instead of going to 'out'.

This issue was also reported by syzbot.

It can be reproduced by following these steps(more details [1]):
1. Obtain more than 32 inputs that have similar hashes, which ends with the
   pattern '0xxxxxxxe6'.
2. Reboot and add the keys obtained in step 1.

The reproducer demonstrates how this issue happened:
1. In the search_nested_keyrings function, when it iterates through the
   slots in a node(below tag ascend_to_node), if the slot pointer is meta
   and node->back_pointer != NULL(it means a root), it will proceed to
   descend_to_node. However, there is an exception. If node is the root,
   and one of the slots points to a shortcut, it will be treated as a
   keyring.
2. Whether the ptr is keyring decided by keyring_ptr_is_keyring function.
   However, KEYRING_PTR_SUBTYPE is 0x2UL, the same as
   ASSOC_ARRAY_PTR_SUBTYPE_MASK.
3. When 32 keys with the similar hashes are added to the tree, the ROOT
   has keys with hashes that are not similar (e.g. slot 0) and it splits
   NODE A without using a shortcut. When NODE A is filled with keys that
   all hashes are xxe6, the keys are similar, NODE A will split with a
   shortcut. Finally, it forms the tree as shown below, where slot 6 points
   to a shortcut.

                      NODE A
              +------>+---+
      ROOT    |       | 0 | xxe6
      +---+   |       +---+
 xxxx | 0 | shortcut  :   : xxe6
      +---+   |       +---+
 xxe6 :   :   |       |   | xxe6
      +---+   |       +---+
      | 6 |---+       :   : xxe6
      +---+           +---+
 xxe6 :   :           | f | xxe6
      +---+           +---+
 xxe6 | f |
      +---+

4. As mentioned above, If a slot(slot 6) of the root points to a shortcut,
   it may be mistakenly transferred to a key*, leading to a read
   out-of-bounds read.

To fix this issue, one should jump to descend_to_node if the ptr is a
shortcut, regardless of whether the node is root or not.

So rq_qos_wake_function() calls wake_up_process(data->task), which calls
try_to_wake_up(), which faults in raw_spin_lock_irqsave(&p->pi_lock).

p comes from data->task, and data comes from the waitqueue entry, which
is stored on the waiter's stack in rq_qos_wait(). Analyzing the core
dump with drgn, I found that the waiter had already woken up and moved
on to a completely unrelated code path, clobbering what was previously
data->task. Meanwhile, the waker was passing the clobbered garbage in
data->task to wake_up_process(), leading to the crash.

What's happening is that in between rq_qos_wake_function() deleting the
waitqueue entry and calling wake_up_process(), rq_qos_wait() is finding
that it already got a token and returning. The race looks like this:

rq_qos_wait()                           rq_qos_wake_function()
==============================================================
prepare_to_wait_exclusive()
                                        data->got_token = true;
                                        list_del_init(&curr->entry);
if (data.got_token)
        break;
finish_wait(&rqw->wait, &data.wq);
  ^- returns immediately because
     list_empty_careful(&wq_entry->entry)
     is true
... return, go do something else ...
                                        wake_up_process(data->task)
                                          (NO LONGER VALID!)-^

Normally, finish_wait() is supposed to synchronize against the waker.
But, as noted above, it is returning immediately because the waitqueue
entry has already been removed from the waitqueue.

The bug is that rq_qos_wake_function() is accessing the waitqueue entry
AFTER deleting it. Note that autoremove_wake_function() wakes the waiter
and THEN deletes the waitqueue entry, which is the proper order.

Fix it by swapping the order. We also need to use
list_del_init_careful() to match the list_empty_careful() in
finish_wait().",'-,4.7,6021727,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7293-1),5,5,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 27, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,223994195,ptdtc-sv-klmsq1.portugal.pt,"10.200.4.150,172.17.0.1",fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:87d7,Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7293-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7293-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,30,4,"Feb 26, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",Ubuntu,CRITICAL,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 20.04.6,'-,'-,25,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,331,,"#table cols=""3""

KVM: Fix a data race on last_boosted_vcpu in kvm_vcpu_on_spin()

Use {READ,WRITE}_ONCE() to access kvm->last_boosted_vcpu to ensure the
loads and stores are atomic.  In the extremely unlikely scenario the
compiler tears the stores, it's theoretically possible for KVM to attempt
to get a vCPU using an out-of-bounds index, e.g. if the write is split
into multiple 8-bit stores, and is paired with a 32-bit load on a VM with
257 vCPUs:

  CPU0                              CPU1
  last_boosted_vcpu = 0xff;

                                    (last_boosted_vcpu = 0x100)

CVE-2024-47742,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

firmware_loader: Block path traversal

Most firmware names are hardcoded strings, or are constructed from fairly
constrained format strings where the dynamic parts are just some hex
numbers or such.

However, there are a couple codepaths in the kernel where firmware file
names contain string components that are passed through from a device or
semi-privileged userspace; the ones I could find (not counting interfaces
that require root privileges) are:

 - lpfc_sli4_request_firmware_update() seems to construct the firmware
   filename from ""ModelName"", a string that was previously parsed out of
   some descriptor (""Vital Product Data"") in lpfc_fill_vpd()
 - nfp_net_fw_find() seems to construct a firmware filename from a model
   name coming from nfp_hwinfo_lookup(pf->hwinfo, ""nffw.partno""), which I
   think parses some descriptor that was read from the device.
   (But this case likely isn't exploitable because the format string looks
   like ""netronome/nic_%s"", and there shouldn't be any *folders* starting
   with ""netronome/nic_"". The previous case was different because there,
   the ""%s"" is *at the start* of the format string.)
 - module_flash_fw_schedule() is reachable from the
   ETHTOOL_MSG_MODULE_FW_FLASH_ACT netlink command, which is marked as
   GENL_UNS_ADMIN_PERM (meaning CAP_NET_ADMIN inside a user namespace is
   enough to pass the privilege check), and takes a userspace-provided
   firmware name.
   (But I think to reach this case, you need to have CAP_NET_ADMIN over a
   network namespace that a special kind of ethernet device is mapped into,
   so I think this is not a viable attack path in practice.)

Fix it by rejecting any firmware names containing "".."" path components.

For what it's worth, I went looking and haven't found any USB device
drivers that use the firmware loader dangerously.",'-,7.8,6021727,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7293-1),5,5,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 27, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,223994195,ptdtc-sv-klmsq1.portugal.pt,"10.200.4.150,172.17.0.1",fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:87d7,Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7293-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7293-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,35,4,"Feb 26, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",Ubuntu,CRITICAL,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 20.04.6,'-,'-,25,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,331,,"#table cols=""3""

nilfs2: fix kernel bug due to missing clearing of buffer delay flag

Syzbot reported that after nilfs2 reads a corrupted file system image
and degrades to read-only, the BUG_ON check for the buffer delay flag
in submit_bh_wbc() may fail, causing a kernel bug.

This is because the buffer delay flag is not cleared when clearing the
buffer state flags to discard a page/folio or a buffer head. So, fix
this.

CVE-2024-49924,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fbdev: pxafb: Fix possible use after free in pxafb_task()

In the pxafb_probe function, it calls the pxafb_init_fbinfo function,
after which &fbi->task is associated with pxafb_task. Moreover,
within this pxafb_init_fbinfo function, the pxafb_blank function
within the &pxafb_ops struct is capable of scheduling work.

If we remove the module which will call pxafb_remove to make cleanup,
it will call unregister_framebuffer function which can call
do_unregister_framebuffer to free fbi->fb through
put_fb_info(fb_info), while the work mentioned above will be used.
The sequence of operations that may lead to a UAF bug is as follows:

wifi: iwlegacy: Clear stale interrupts before resuming device

iwl4965 fails upon resume from hibernation on my laptop. The reason
seems to be a stale interrupt which isn't being cleared out before
interrupts are enabled. We end up with a race beween the resume
trying to bring things back up, and the restart work (queued form
the interrupt handler) trying to bring things down. Eventually
the whole thing blows up.

Fix the problem by clearing out any stale interrupts before
interrupts get enabled during resume.

CVE-2024-50195,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

posix-clock: Fix missing timespec64 check in pc_clock_settime()

As Andrew pointed out, it will make sense that the PTP core
checked timespec64 struct's tv_sec and tv_nsec range before calling
ptp->info->settime64().

As the man manual of clock_settime() said, if tp.tv_sec is negative or
tp.tv_nsec is outside the range [0..999,999,999], it should return EINVAL,
which include dynamic clocks which handles PTP clock, and the condition is
consistent with timespec64_valid(). As Thomas suggested, timespec64_valid()
only check the timespec is valid, but not ensure that the time is
in a valid range, so check it ahead using timespec64_valid_strict()
in pc_clock_settime() and return -EINVAL if not valid.

There are some drivers that use tp->tv_sec and tp->tv_nsec directly to
write registers without validity checks and assume that the higher layer
has checked it, which is dangerous and will benefit from this, such as
hclge_ptp_settime(), igb_ptp_settime_i210(), _rcar_gen4_ptp_settime(),

nilfs2: fix kernel bug due to missing clearing of checked flag

Syzbot reported that in directory operations after nilfs2 detects
filesystem corruption and degrades to read-only,

fail the BUG_ON check for accesses exceeding the folio/page size,

cleared when it was discarded by nilfs2's own routine, which causes the

ext4: fix i_data_sem unlock order in ext4_ind_migrate()

Fuzzing reports a possible deadlock in jbd2_log_wait_commit.

This issue is triggered when an EXT4_IOC_MIGRATE ioctl is set to require
synchronous updates because the file descriptor is opened with O_SYNC.
This can lead to the jbd2_journal_stop() function calling
jbd2_might_wait_for_commit(), potentially causing a deadlock if the
EXT4_IOC_MIGRATE call races with a write(2) system call.

This problem only arises when CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING is enabled. In this
case, the jbd2_might_wait_for_commit macro locks jbd2_handle in the
jbd2_journal_stop function while i_data_sem is locked. This triggers
lockdep because the jbd2_journal_start function might also lock the same
jbd2_handle simultaneously.

CVE-2024-13176,"Issue summary: A timing side-channel which could potentially allow recovering
the private key exists in the ECDSA signature computation.

Impact summary: A timing side-channel in ECDSA signature computations
could allow recovering the private key by an attacker. However, measuring
the timing would require either local access to the signing application or
a very fast network connection with low latency.

There is a timing signal of around 300 nanoseconds when the top word of
the inverted ECDSA nonce value is zero. This can happen with significant
probability only for some of the supported elliptic curves. In particular
the NIST P-521 curve is affected. To be able to measure this leak, the attacker
process must either be located in the same physical computer or must
have a very fast network connection with low latency. For that reason
the severity of this vulnerability is Low.",'-,'-,6021674,Ubuntu Security Notification for Open Secure Sockets Layer (OpenSSL) Vulnerabilities (USN-7278-1),4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 24, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,223994195,ptdtc-sv-klmsq1.portugal.pt,"10.200.4.150,172.17.0.1",fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:87d7,Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7278-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7278-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,30,6,"Feb 24, 2025","Feb 20, 2025",Ubuntu,MEDIUM,High Lateral Movement,Ubuntu Linux 20.04.6,'-,'-,34,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",No,2,331,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-9143,"Issue summary: Use of the low-level GF(2^m) elliptic curve APIs with untrusted
explicit values for the field polynomial can lead to out-of-bounds memory reads
or writes.

Impact summary: Out of bound memory writes can lead to an application crash or
even a possibility of a remote code execution, however, in all the protocols
involving Elliptic Curve Cryptography that we're aware of, either only ""named
curves"" are supported, or, if explicit curve parameters are supported, they
specify an X9.62 encoding of binary (GF(2^m)) curves that can't represent
problematic input values. Thus the likelihood of existence of a vulnerable
application is low.

In particular, the X9.62 encoding is used for ECC keys in X.509 certificates,
so problematic inputs cannot occur in the context of processing X.509
certificates.  Any problematic use-cases would have to be using an ""exotic""
curve encoding.

The affected APIs include: EC_GROUP_new_curve_GF2m(), EC_GROUP_new_from_params(),
and various supporting BN_GF2m_*() functions.

Applications working with ""exotic"" explicit binary (GF(2^m)) curve parameters,
that make it possible to represent invalid field polynomials with a zero
constant term, via the above or similar APIs, may terminate abruptly as a
result of reading or writing outside of array bounds.  Remote code execution
cannot easily be ruled out.

CVE-2024-41066,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ibmvnic: Add tx check to prevent skb leak

Below is a summary of how the driver stores a reference to an skb during
transmit:
    tx_buff[free_map[consumer_index]]->skb = new_skb;
    free_map[consumer_index] = IBMVNIC_INVALID_MAP;
    consumer_index ++;
Where variable data looks like this:
    free_map == [4, IBMVNIC_INVALID_MAP, IBMVNIC_INVALID_MAP, 0, 3]
                                               	consumer_index^
    tx_buff == [skb=null, skb=<ptr>, skb=<ptr>, skb=null, skb=null]

The driver has checks to ensure that free_map[consumer_index] pointed to
a valid index but there was no check to ensure that this index pointed
to an unused/null skb address. So, if, by some chance, our free_map and
tx_buff lists become out of sync then we were previously risking an
skb memory leak. This could then cause tcp congestion control to stop
sending packets, eventually leading to ETIMEDOUT.

CVE-2024-47696,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/iwcm: Fix WARNING:at_kernel/workqueue.c:#check_flush_dependency

In the commit aee2424246f9 (""RDMA/iwcm: Fix a use-after-free related to
destroying CM IDs""), the function flush_workqueue is invoked to flush the
work queue iwcm_wq.

But at that time, the work queue iwcm_wq was created via the function
alloc_ordered_workqueue without the flag WQ_MEM_RECLAIM.

Because the current process is trying to flush the whole iwcm_wq, if
iwcm_wq doesn't have the flag WQ_MEM_RECLAIM, verify that the current
process is not reclaiming memory or running on a workqueue which doesn't
have the flag WQ_MEM_RECLAIM as that can break forward-progress guarantee
leading to a deadlock.

CVE-2024-49867,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: wait for fixup workers before stopping cleaner kthread during umount

During unmount, at close_ctree(), we have the following steps in this order:

1) Park the cleaner kthread - this doesn't destroy the kthread, it basically
   halts its execution (wake ups against it work but do nothing);

2) We stop the cleaner kthread - this results in freeing the respective
   struct task_struct;

3) We call btrfs_stop_all_workers() which waits for any jobs running in all
   the work queues and then free the work queues.

Syzbot reported a case where a fixup worker resulted in a crash when doing
a delayed iput on its inode while attempting to wake up the cleaner at
btrfs_add_delayed_iput(), because the task_struct of the cleaner kthread
was already freed. This can happen during unmount because we don't wait
for any fixup workers still running before we call kthread_stop() against
the cleaner kthread, which stops and free all its resources.

Fix this by waiting for any fixup workers at close_ctree() before we call
kthread_stop() against the cleaner and run pending delayed iputs.

The stack traces reported by syzbot were the following:

[CAUSE]
The allocation failure happens at the start_transaction() inside
prepare_to_relocate(), and during the error handling we call
unset_reloc_control(), which makes fs_info->balance_ctl to be NULL.

Then we continue the error path cleanup in btrfs_balance() by calling
reset_balance_state() which will call del_balance_item() to fully delete
the balance item in the root tree.

However during the small window between set_reloc_contrl() and
unset_reloc_control(), we can have a subvolume tree update and created a
reloc_root for that subvolume.

Then we go into the final btrfs_commit_transaction() of
del_balance_item(), and into btrfs_update_reloc_root() inside
commit_fs_roots().

That function checks if fs_info->reloc_ctl is in the merge_reloc_tree
stage, but since fs_info->reloc_ctl is NULL, it results a NULL pointer
dereference.

[FIX]
Just add extra check on fs_info->reloc_ctl inside
btrfs_update_reloc_root(), before checking
fs_info->reloc_ctl->merge_reloc_tree.

That DEAD_RELOC_TREE handling is to prevent further modification to the
reloc tree during merge stage, but since there is no reloc_ctl at all,
we do not need to bother that.",'-,5.5,6021727,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7293-1),5,5,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 26, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,223969342,ptdtc-sv-klmsq2.portugal.pt,10.200.5.150,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:a2a1,Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7293-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7293-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,30,4,"Feb 26, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",Ubuntu,CRITICAL,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 20.04.6,'-,'-,26,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,249,,"#table cols=""3""

dvb_register_adapter() would already be enforcing it.

that the register functions already did the needed checks.

CVE-2024-50194,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64: probes: Fix uprobes for big-endian kernels

The arm64 uprobes code is broken for big-endian kernels as it doesn't
convert the in-memory instruction encoding (which is always
little-endian) into the kernel's native endianness before analyzing and
simulating instructions. This may result in a few distinct problems:

* The kernel may may erroneously reject probing an instruction which can
  safely be probed.

* The kernel may erroneously erroneously permit stepping an
  instruction out-of-line when that instruction cannot be stepped
  out-of-line safely.

* The kernel may erroneously simulate instruction incorrectly dur to
  interpretting the byte-swapped encoding.

The endianness mismatch isn't caught by the compiler or sparse because:

* The arch_uprobe::{insn,ixol} fields are encoded as arrays of u8, so
  the compiler and sparse have no idea these contain a little-endian
  32-bit value. The core uprobes code populates these with a memcpy()
  which similarly does not handle endianness.

* While the uprobe_opcode_t type is an alias for __le32, both
  arch_uprobe_analyze_insn() and arch_uprobe_skip_sstep() cast from u8[]
  to the similarly-named probe_opcode_t, which is an alias for u32.
  Hence there is no endianness conversion warning.

Fix this by changing the arch_uprobe::{insn,ixol} fields to __le32 and
adding the appropriate __le32_to_cpu() conversions prior to consuming
the instruction encoding. The core uprobes copies these fields as opaque
ranges of bytes, and so is unaffected by this change.

At the same time, remove MAX_UINSN_BYTES and consistently use
AARCH64_INSN_SIZE for clarity.

CVE-2024-47740,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

f2fs: Require FMODE_WRITE for atomic write ioctls

The F2FS ioctls for starting and committing atomic writes check for
inode_owner_or_capable(), but this does not give LSMs like SELinux or
Landlock an opportunity to deny the write access - if the caller's FSUID
matches the inode's UID, inode_owner_or_capable() immediately returns true.

There are scenarios where LSMs want to deny a process the ability to write
particular files, even files that the FSUID of the process owns; but this
can currently partially be bypassed using atomic write ioctls in two ways:

 - F2FS_IOC_START_ATOMIC_REPLACE + F2FS_IOC_COMMIT_ATOMIC_WRITE can
   truncate an inode to size 0
 - F2FS_IOC_START_ATOMIC_WRITE + F2FS_IOC_ABORT_ATOMIC_WRITE can revert
   changes another process concurrently made to a file

Fix it by requiring FMODE_WRITE for these operations, just like for
F2FS_IOC_MOVE_RANGE. Since any legitimate caller should only be using these
ioctls when intending to write into the file, that seems unlikely to break

CVE-2024-47699,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nilfs2: fix potential null-ptr-deref in nilfs_btree_insert()

Patch series ""nilfs2: fix potential issues with empty b-tree nodes"".

This series addresses three potential issues with empty b-tree nodes that
can occur with corrupted filesystem images, including one recently
discovered by syzbot.


This patch (of 3):

If a b-tree is broken on the device, and the b-tree height is greater than
2 (the level of the root node is greater than 1) even if the number of
child nodes of the b-tree root is 0, a NULL pointer dereference occurs in
nilfs_btree_prepare_insert(), which is called from nilfs_btree_insert().

This is because, when the number of child nodes of the b-tree root is 0,
nilfs_btree_do_lookup() does not set the block buffer head in any of
path[x].bp_bh, leaving it as the initial value of NULL, but if the level
of the b-tree root node is greater than 1, nilfs_btree_get_nonroot_node(),
which accesses the buffer memory of path[x].bp_bh, is called.

Fix this issue by adding a check to nilfs_btree_root_broken(), which
performs sanity checks when reading the root node from the device, to
detect this inconsistency.

CVE-2024-49878,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

resource: fix region_intersects() vs add_memory_driver_managed()

On a system with CXL memory, the resource tree (/proc/iomem) related to
CXL memory may look like something as follows.

490000000-50fffffff : CXL Window 0
  490000000-50fffffff : region0
    490000000-50fffffff : dax0.0
      490000000-50fffffff : System RAM (kmem)

Because drivers/dax/kmem.c calls add_memory_driver_managed() during
onlining CXL memory, which makes ""System RAM (kmem)"" a descendant of ""CXL
Window X"".  This confuses region_intersects(), which expects all ""System
RAM"" resources to be at the top level of iomem_resource.  This can lead to
bugs.

For example, when the following command line is executed to write some
memory in CXL memory range via /dev/mem,

 $ dd if=data of=/dev/mem bs=$((1 << 10)) seek=$((0x490000000 >> 10)) count=1
 dd: error writing '/dev/mem': Bad address
 1+0 records in
 0+0 records out
 0 bytes copied, 0.0283507 s, 0.0 kB/s

the command fails as expected.  However, the error code is wrong.  It
should be ""Operation not permitted"" instead of ""Bad address"".  More
seriously, the /dev/mem permission checking in devmem_is_allowed() passes
incorrectly.  Although the accessing is prevented later because ioremap()
isn't allowed to map system RAM, it is a potential security issue.  During
command executing, the following warning is reported in the kernel log for
calling ioremap() on system RAM.

 ioremap on RAM at 0x0000000490000000 - 0x0000000490000fff

The details of command execution process are as follows.  In the above
resource tree, ""System RAM"" is a descendant of ""CXL Window 0"" instead of a
top level resource.  So, region_intersects() will report no System RAM
resources in the CXL memory region incorrectly, because it only checks the
top level resources.  Consequently, devmem_is_allowed() will return 1
(allow access via /dev/mem) for CXL memory region incorrectly. 
Fortunately, ioremap() doesn't allow to map System RAM and reject the
access.

So, region_intersects() needs to be fixed to work correctly with the
resource tree with ""System RAM"" not at top level as above.  To fix it, if
we found a unmatched resource in the top level, we will continue to search
matched resources in its descendant resources.  So, we will not miss any
matched resources in resource tree anymore.

In the new implementation, an example resource tree

|------------- ""CXL Window 0"" ------------|
|-- ""System RAM"" --|

will behave similar as the following fake resource tree for
region_intersects(, IORESOURCE_SYSTEM_RAM, ),

CVE-2024-50229,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nilfs2: fix potential deadlock with newly created symlinks

Syzbot reported that page_symlink(), called by nilfs_symlink(), triggers
memory reclamation involving the filesystem layer, which can result in
circular lock dependencies among the reader/writer semaphore
nilfs->ns_segctor_sem, s_writers percpu_rwsem (intwrite) and the
fs_reclaim pseudo lock.

This is because after commit 21fc61c73c39 (""don't put symlink bodies in
pagecache into highmem""), the gfp flags of the page cache for symbolic
links are overwritten to GFP_KERNEL via inode_nohighmem().

This is not a problem for symlinks read from the backing device, because
the __GFP_FS flag is dropped after inode_nohighmem() is called.  However,
when a new symlink is created with nilfs_symlink(), the gfp flags remain
overwritten to GFP_KERNEL.  Then, memory allocation called from
page_symlink() etc.  triggers memory reclamation including the FS layer,
which may call nilfs_evict_inode() or nilfs_dirty_inode().  And these can
cause a deadlock if they are called while nilfs->ns_segctor_sem is held:

Fix this issue by dropping the __GFP_FS flag from the page cache GFP flags
of newly created symlinks in the same way that nilfs_new_inode() and
__nilfs_read_inode() do, as a workaround until we adopt nofs allocation
scope consistently or improve the locking constraints.",'-,5.5,6021727,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7293-1),5,5,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 26, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,223969342,ptdtc-sv-klmsq2.portugal.pt,10.200.5.150,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:a2a1,Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7293-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7293-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,30,4,"Feb 26, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",Ubuntu,CRITICAL,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 20.04.6,'-,'-,26,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,249,,"#table cols=""3""

When applying padding, the buffer is not zeroed, which results in memory
disclosure. The mentioned data is observed on the wire. This patch uses
skb_put_padto() to pad Ethernet frames properly. The mentioned function
zeroes the expanded buffer.

In case the packet cannot be padded it is silently dropped. Statistics
are also not incremented. This driver does not support statistics in the
old 32-bit format or the new 64-bit format. These will be added in the
future. In its current form, the patch should be easily backported to
stable versions.

CVE-2024-43863,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/vmwgfx: Fix a deadlock in dma buf fence polling

Introduce a version of the fence ops that on release doesn't remove
the fence from the pending list, and thus doesn't require a lock to
fix poll->fence wait->fence unref deadlocks.

vmwgfx overwrites the wait callback to iterate over the list of all
fences and update their status, to do that it holds a lock to prevent
the list modifcations from other threads. The fence destroy callback
both deletes the fence and removes it from the list of pending
fences, for which it holds a lock.

dma buf polling cb unrefs a fence after it's been signaled: so the poll
calls the wait, which signals the fences, which are being destroyed.
The destruction tries to acquire the lock on the pending fences list
which it can never get because it's held by the wait from which it
was called.

wifi: iwlwifi: mvm: don't wait for tx queues if firmware is dead

There is a WARNING in iwl_trans_wait_tx_queues_empty() (that was
recently converted from just a message), that can be hit if we
wait for TX queues to become empty after firmware died. Clearly,
we can't expect anything from the firmware after it's declared dead.

Don't call iwl_trans_wait_tx_queues_empty() in this case. While it could
be a good idea to stop the flow earlier, the flush functions do some
maintenance work that is not related to the firmware, so keep that part
of the code running even when the firmware is not running.

mm: avoid leaving partial pfn mappings around in error case

As Jann points out, PFN mappings are special, because unlike normal
memory mappings, there is no lifetime information associated with the
mapping - it is just a raw mapping of PFNs with no reference counting of
a 'struct page'.

That's all very much intentional, but it does mean that it's easy to
mess up the cleanup in case of errors.  Yes, a failed mmap() will always
eventually clean up any partial mappings, but without any explicit
lifetime in the page table mapping itself, it's very easy to do the
error handling in the wrong order.

In particular, it's easy to mistakenly free the physical backing store
before the page tables are actually cleaned up and (temporarily) have
stale dangling PTE entries.

To make this situation less error-prone, just make sure that any partial
pfn mapping is torn down early, before any other error handling.",'-,5.5,6021727,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7293-1),5,5,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 26, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,223969342,ptdtc-sv-klmsq2.portugal.pt,10.200.5.150,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:a2a1,Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7293-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7293-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,37,4,"Feb 26, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",Ubuntu,CRITICAL,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 20.04.6,'-,'-,26,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,249,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-50039,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/sched: accept TCA_STAB only for root qdisc

Most qdiscs maintain their backlog using qdisc_pkt_len(skb)
on the assumption it is invariant between the enqueue()
and dequeue() handlers.

Unfortunately syzbot can crash a host rather easily using
a TBF + SFQ combination, with an STAB on SFQ [1]

We can't support TCA_STAB on arbitrary level, this would
require to maintain per-qdisc storage.

CVE-2024-47706,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

block, bfq: fix possible UAF for bfqq->bic with merge chain

1) initial state, three tasks:

		Process 1       Process 2	Process 3
		 (BIC1)          (BIC2)		 (BIC3)
		  |  ?            |  ?		  |  ?
		  |  |            |  |		  |  |
		  V  |            V  |		  V  |
		  bfqq1           bfqq2		  bfqq3
process ref:	   1		    1		    1

2) bfqq1 merged to bfqq2:

		Process 1       Process 2	Process 3
		 (BIC1)          (BIC2)		 (BIC3)
		  |               |		  |  ?
		  \--------------\|		  |  |
		                  V		  V  |
		  bfqq1--------->bfqq2		  bfqq3
process ref:	   0		    2		    1

3) bfqq2 merged to bfqq3:

		Process 1       Process 2	Process 3
		 (BIC1)          (BIC2)		 (BIC3)
	 here -> ?                |		  |
		  \--------------\ \-------------\|
		                  V		  V
		  bfqq1--------->bfqq2---------->bfqq3
process ref:	   0		    1		    3

In this case, IO from Process 1 will get bfqq2 from BIC1 first, and then
get bfqq3 through merge chain, and finially handle IO by bfqq3.
Howerver, current code will think bfqq2 is owned by BIC1, like initial
state, and set bfqq2->bic to BIC1.

bfq_insert_request
-> by Process 1
 bfqq = bfq_init_rq(rq)
  bfqq = bfq_get_bfqq_handle_split
   bfqq = bic_to_bfqq
   -> get bfqq2 from BIC1
 bfqq->ref++
 rq->elv.priv[0] = bic
 rq->elv.priv[1] = bfqq
 if (bfqq_process_refs(bfqq) == 1)
  bfqq->bic = bic
  -> record BIC1 to bfqq2

  __bfq_insert_request
   new_bfqq = bfq_setup_cooperator
   -> get bfqq3 from bfqq2->new_bfqq
   bfqq_request_freed(bfqq)
   new_bfqq->ref++
   rq->elv.priv[1] = new_bfqq
   -> handle IO by bfqq3

Fix the problem by checking bfqq is from merge chain fist. And this
might fix a following problem reported by our syzkaller(unreproducible):

CVE-2024-50278,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dm cache: fix potential out-of-bounds access on the first resume

Out-of-bounds access occurs if the fast device is expanded unexpectedly
before the first-time resume of the cache table. This happens because
expanding the fast device requires reloading the cache table for
cache_create to allocate new in-core data structures that fit the new
size, and the check in cache_preresume is not performed during the
first resume, leading to the issue.

Reproduce steps:

1. prepare component devices:

dmsetup create cmeta --table ""0 8192 linear /dev/sdc 0""
dmsetup create cdata --table ""0 65536 linear /dev/sdc 8192""
dmsetup create corig --table ""0 524288 linear /dev/sdc 262144""
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/mapper/cmeta bs=4k count=1 oflag=direct

2. load a cache table of 512 cache blocks, and deliberately expand the
   fast device before resuming the cache, making the in-core data
   structures inadequate.

dmsetup create cache --notable
dmsetup reload cache --table ""0 524288 cache /dev/mapper/cmeta \
/dev/mapper/cdata /dev/mapper/corig 128 2 metadata2 writethrough smq 0""
dmsetup reload cdata --table ""0 131072 linear /dev/sdc 8192""
dmsetup resume cdata
dmsetup resume cache

3. suspend the cache to write out the in-core dirty bitset and hint
   array, leading to out-of-bounds access to the dirty bitset at offset
   0x40:

dmsetup suspend cache

can: bcm: Clear bo->bcm_proc_read after remove_proc_entry().

syzbot reported a warning in bcm_release(). [0]

The blamed change fixed another warning that is triggered when

been unregistered.

However, if the socket is just close()d without the 2nd connect(), the
remaining bo->bcm_proc_read triggers unnecessary remove_proc_entry()

smb: client: fix OOBs when building SMB2_IOCTL request

When using encryption, either enforced by the server or when using
'seal' mount option, the client will squash all compound request buffers
down for encryption into a single iov in smb2_set_next_command().

SMB2_ioctl_init() allocates a small buffer (448 bytes) to hold the
SMB2_IOCTL request in the first iov, and if the user passes an input

CVE-2024-50273,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: reinitialize delayed ref list after deleting it from the list

At insert_delayed_ref() if we need to update the action of an existing
ref to BTRFS_DROP_DELAYED_REF, we delete the ref from its ref head's
ref_add_list using list_del(), which leaves the ref's add_list member
not reinitialized, as list_del() sets the next and prev members of the
list to LIST_POISON1 and LIST_POISON2, respectively.

If later we end up calling drop_delayed_ref() against the ref, which can
happen during merging or when destroying delayed refs due to a transaction
abort, we can trigger a crash since at drop_delayed_ref() we call
list_empty() against the ref's add_list, which returns false since
the list was not reinitialized after the list_del() and as a consequence
we call list_del() again at drop_delayed_ref(). This results in an
invalid list access since the next and prev members are set to poison
pointers, resulting in a splat if CONFIG_LIST_HARDENED and
CONFIG_DEBUG_LIST are set or invalid poison pointer dereferences
otherwise.

So fix this by deleting from the list with list_del_init() instead.",'-,5.5,6021727,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7293-1),5,5,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 26, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,223969342,ptdtc-sv-klmsq2.portugal.pt,10.200.5.150,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:a2a1,Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7293-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7293-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,'-,4,"Feb 26, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",Ubuntu,CRITICAL,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 20.04.6,'-,'-,26,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,249,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-49985,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

i2c: stm32f7: Do not prepare/unprepare clock during runtime suspend/resume

In case there is any sort of clock controller attached to this I2C bus
controller, for example Versaclock or even an AIC32x4 I2C codec, then
an I2C transfer triggered from the clock controller clk_ops .prepare
callback may trigger a deadlock on drivers/clk/clk.c prepare_lock mutex.

This is because the clock controller first grabs the prepare_lock mutex
and then performs the prepare operation, including its I2C access. The
I2C access resumes this I2C bus controller via .runtime_resume callback,
which calls clk_prepare_enable(), which attempts to grab the prepare_lock
mutex again and deadlocks.

Since the clock are already prepared since probe() and unprepared in
remove(), use simple clk_enable()/clk_disable() calls to enable and
disable the clock on runtime suspend and resume, to avoid hitting the
prepare_lock mutex.",'-,5.5,6021727,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7293-1),5,5,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 26, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,223969342,ptdtc-sv-klmsq2.portugal.pt,10.200.5.150,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:a2a1,Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7293-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7293-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,30,4,"Feb 26, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",Ubuntu,CRITICAL,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 20.04.6,'-,'-,26,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,249,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-49982,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

aoe: fix the potential use-after-free problem in more places

For fixing CVE-2023-6270, f98364e92662 (""aoe: fix the potential
use-after-free problem in aoecmd_cfg_pkts"") makes tx() calling dev_put()
instead of doing in aoecmd_cfg_pkts(). It avoids that the tx() runs
into use-after-free.

Then Nicolai Stange found more places in aoe have potential use-after-free
problem with tx(). e.g. revalidate(), aoecmd_ata_rw(), resend(), probe()
and aoecmd_cfg_rsp(). Those functions also use aoenet_xmit() to push
packet to tx queue. So they should also use dev_hold() to increase the
refcnt of skb->dev.

On the other hand, moving dev_put() to tx() causes that the refcnt of
skb->dev be reduced to a negative value, because corresponding
dev_hold() are not called in revalidate(), aoecmd_ata_rw(), resend(),
probe(), and aoecmd_cfg_rsp().

In the `wilc_parse_join_bss_param` function, the TSF field of the `ies`

CVE-2024-47679,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vfs: fix race between evice_inodes() and find_inode()&iput()

Hi, all

Recently I noticed a bug[1] in btrfs, after digged it into
and I believe it'a race in vfs.

Let's assume there's a inode (ie ino 261) with i_count 1 is
called by iput(), and there's a concurrent thread calling
generic_shutdown_super().

cpu0:                              cpu1:
iput() // i_count is 1
  ->spin_lock(inode)
  ->dec i_count to 0
  ->iput_final()                    generic_shutdown_super()
    ->__inode_add_lru()               ->evict_inodes()
      // cause some reason[2]           ->if (atomic_read(inode->i_count)) continue;
      // return before                  // inode 261 passed the above check
      // list_lru_add_obj()             // and then schedule out
   ->spin_unlock()
// note here: the inode 261
// was still at sb list and hash list,
// and I_FREEING|I_WILL_FREE was not been set

btrfs_iget()
  // after some function calls
  ->find_inode()
    // found the above inode 261
    ->spin_lock(inode)
   // check I_FREEING|I_WILL_FREE
   // and passed
      ->__iget()
    ->spin_unlock(inode)                // schedule back
                                        ->spin_lock(inode)
                                        // check (I_NEW|I_FREEING|I_WILL_FREE) flags,
                                        // passed and set I_FREEING
iput()                                  ->spin_unlock(inode)
  ->spin_lock(inode)			  ->evict()
  // dec i_count to 0
  ->iput_final()
    ->spin_unlock()
    ->evict()

Now, we have two threads simultaneously evicting
the same inode, which may trigger the BUG(inode->i_state & I_CLEAR)
statement both within clear_inode() and iput().

To fix the bug, recheck the inode->i_count after holding i_lock.
Because in the most scenarios, the first check is valid, and
the overhead of spin_lock() can be reduced.

If there is any misunderstanding, please let me know, thanks.

CVE-2024-50045,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: br_netfilter: fix panic with metadata_dst skb

Fix a kernel panic in the br_netfilter module when sending untagged
traffic via a VxLAN device.
This happens during the check for fragmentation in br_nf_dev_queue_xmit.

It is dependent on:
1) the br_netfilter module being loaded;
2) net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables set to 1;
3) a bridge with a VxLAN (single-vxlan-device) netdevice as a bridge port;
4) untagged frames with size higher than the VxLAN MTU forwarded/flooded

When forwarding the untagged packet to the VxLAN bridge port, before
the netfilter hooks are called, br_handle_egress_vlan_tunnel is called and
changes the skb_dst to the tunnel dst. The tunnel_dst is a metadata type
of dst, i.e., skb_valid_dst(skb) is false, and metadata->dst.dev is NULL.

Then in the br_netfilter hooks, in br_nf_dev_queue_xmit, there's a check
for frames that needs to be fragmented: frames with higher MTU than the
VxLAN device end up calling br_nf_ip_fragment, which in turns call
ip_skb_dst_mtu.

The ip_dst_mtu tries to use the skb_dst(skb) as if it was a valid dst
with valid dst->dev, thus the crash.

This case was never supported in the first place, so drop the packet
instead.

nilfs2: propagate directory read errors from nilfs_find_entry()

Syzbot reported that a task hang occurs in vcs_open() during a fuzzing
test for nilfs2.

The root cause of this problem is that in nilfs_find_entry(), which
searches for directory entries, ignores errors when loading a directory
page/folio via nilfs_get_folio() fails.

If the filesystem images is corrupted, and the i_size of the directory
inode is large, and the directory page/folio is successfully read but
fails the sanity check, for example when it is zero-filled,
nilfs_check_folio() may continue to spit out error messages in bursts.

Fix this issue by propagating the error to the callers when loading a
page/folio fails in nilfs_find_entry().

The current interface of nilfs_find_entry() and its callers is outdated
and cannot propagate error codes such as -EIO and -ENOMEM returned via
nilfs_find_entry(), so fix it together.",'-,5.5,6021727,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7293-1),5,5,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 26, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,223969342,ptdtc-sv-klmsq2.portugal.pt,10.200.5.150,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:a2a1,Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7293-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7293-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,30,4,"Feb 26, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",Ubuntu,CRITICAL,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 20.04.6,'-,'-,26,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,249,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-49949,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: avoid potential underflow in qdisc_pkt_len_init() with UFO

After commit 7c6d2ecbda83 (""net: be more gentle about silly gso
requests coming from user"") virtio_net_hdr_to_skb() had sanity check
to detect malicious attempts from user space to cook a bad GSO packet.

Then commit cf9acc90c80ec (""net: virtio_net_hdr_to_skb: count
transport header in UFO"") while fixing one issue, allowed user space
to cook a GSO packet with the following characteristic :

IPv4 SKB_GSO_UDP, gso_size=3, skb->len = 28.

When this packet arrives in qdisc_pkt_len_init(), we end up
with hdr_len = 28 (IPv4 header + UDP header), matching skb->len

Then the following sets gso_segs to 0 :

gso_segs = DIV_ROUND_UP(skb->len - hdr_len,
                        shinfo->gso_size);

Then later we set qdisc_skb_cb(skb)->pkt_len to back to zero :/

qdisc_skb_cb(skb)->pkt_len += (gso_segs - 1) * hdr_len;

This leads to the following crash in fq_codel [1]

qdisc_pkt_len_init() is best effort, we only want an estimation
of the bytes sent on the wire, not crashing the kernel.

This patch is fixing this particular issue, a following one
adds more sanity checks for another potential bug.

gpio: prevent potential speculation leaks in gpio_device_get_desc()

Userspace may trigger a speculative read of an address outside the gpio
descriptor array.
Users can do that by calling gpio_ioctl() with an offset out of range.
Offset is copied from user and then used as an array index to get
the gpio descriptor without sanitization in gpio_device_get_desc().

This change ensures that the offset is sanitized by using
array_index_nospec() to mitigate any possibility of speculative
information leaks.

CVE-2024-50099,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64: probes: Remove broken LDR (literal) uprobe support

The simulate_ldr_literal() and simulate_ldrsw_literal() functions are
unsafe to use for uprobes. Both functions were originally written for
use with kprobes, and access memory with plain C accesses. When uprobes
was added, these were reused unmodified even though they cannot safely
access user memory.

There are three key problems:

1) The plain C accesses do not have corresponding extable entries, and
   thus if they encounter a fault the kernel will treat these as
   unintentional accesses to user memory, resulting in a BUG() which
   will kill the kernel thread, and likely lead to further issues (e.g.
   lockup or panic()).

2) The plain C accesses are subject to HW PAN and SW PAN, and so when
   either is in use, any attempt to simulate an access to user memory
   will fault. Thus neither simulate_ldr_literal() nor
   simulate_ldrsw_literal() can do anything useful when simulating a
   user instruction on any system with HW PAN or SW PAN.

3) The plain C accesses are privileged, as they run in kernel context,
   and in practice can access a small range of kernel virtual addresses.
   The instructions they simulate have a range of +/-1MiB, and since the
   simulated instructions must itself be a user instructions in the
   TTBR0 address range, these can address the final 1MiB of the TTBR1
   acddress range by wrapping downwards from an address in the first
   1MiB of the TTBR0 address range.

   In contemporary kernels the last 8MiB of TTBR1 address range is
   reserved, and accesses to this will always fault, meaning this is no
   worse than (1).

   Historically, it was theoretically possible for the linear map or
   vmemmap to spill into the final 8MiB of the TTBR1 address range, but
   in practice this is extremely unlikely to occur as this would
   require either:

   * Having enough physical memory to fill the entire linear map all the
     way to the final 1MiB of the TTBR1 address range.

   * Getting unlucky with KASLR randomization of the linear map such
     that the populated region happens to overlap with the last 1MiB of
     the TTBR address range.

   ... and in either case if we were to spill into the final page there
   would be larger problems as the final page would alias with error
   pointers.

Practically speaking, (1) and (2) are the big issues. Given there have
been no reports of problems since the broken code was introduced, it
appears that no-one is relying on probing these instructions with
uprobes.

Avoid these issues by not allowing uprobes on LDR (literal) and LDRSW
(literal), limiting the use of simulate_ldr_literal() and
simulate_ldrsw_literal() to kprobes. Attempts to place uprobes on LDR
(literal) and LDRSW (literal) will be rejected as
arm_probe_decode_insn() will return INSN_REJECTED. In future we can
consider introducing working uprobes support for these instructions, but
this will require more significant work.",'-,5.5,6021727,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7293-1),5,5,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 26, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,223969342,ptdtc-sv-klmsq2.portugal.pt,10.200.5.150,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:a2a1,Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7293-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7293-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,30,4,"Feb 26, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",Ubuntu,CRITICAL,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 20.04.6,'-,'-,26,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,249,,"#table cols=""3""

mailbox: bcm2835: Fix timeout during suspend mode

During noirq suspend phase the Raspberry Pi power driver suffer of
firmware property timeouts. The reason is that the IRQ of the underlying
BCM2835 mailbox is disabled and rpi_firmware_property_list() will always
run into a timeout [1].

Since the VideoCore side isn't consider as a wakeup source, set the
IRQF_NO_SUSPEND flag for the mailbox IRQ in order to keep it enabled
during suspend-resume cycle.

The issue was in the reflink workfow while reserving space for inline
xattr.  The problematic function is ocfs2_reflink_xattr_inline().  By the
time this function is called the reflink tree is already recreated at the
destination inode from the source inode.  At this point, this function
reserves space for inline xattrs at the destination inode without even
checking if there is space at the root metadata block.  It simply reduces
the l_count from 243 to 227 thereby making space of 256 bytes for inline
xattr whereas the inode already has extents beyond this index (in this
case up to 230), thereby causing corruption.

The fix for this is to reserve space for inline metadata at the destination
inode before the reflink tree gets recreated. The customer has verified the
fix.",'-,5.5,6021727,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7293-1),5,5,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 26, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,223969342,ptdtc-sv-klmsq2.portugal.pt,10.200.5.150,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:a2a1,Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7293-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7293-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,30,4,"Feb 26, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",Ubuntu,CRITICAL,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 20.04.6,'-,'-,26,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,249,,"#table cols=""3""

This issue was also reported by syzbot.

It can be reproduced by following these steps(more details [1]):
1. Obtain more than 32 inputs that have similar hashes, which ends with the
   pattern '0xxxxxxxe6'.
2. Reboot and add the keys obtained in step 1.

The reproducer demonstrates how this issue happened:
1. In the search_nested_keyrings function, when it iterates through the
   slots in a node(below tag ascend_to_node), if the slot pointer is meta
   and node->back_pointer != NULL(it means a root), it will proceed to
   descend_to_node. However, there is an exception. If node is the root,
   and one of the slots points to a shortcut, it will be treated as a
   keyring.
2. Whether the ptr is keyring decided by keyring_ptr_is_keyring function.
   However, KEYRING_PTR_SUBTYPE is 0x2UL, the same as
   ASSOC_ARRAY_PTR_SUBTYPE_MASK.
3. When 32 keys with the similar hashes are added to the tree, the ROOT
   has keys with hashes that are not similar (e.g. slot 0) and it splits
   NODE A without using a shortcut. When NODE A is filled with keys that
   all hashes are xxe6, the keys are similar, NODE A will split with a
   shortcut. Finally, it forms the tree as shown below, where slot 6 points
   to a shortcut.

                      NODE A
              +------>+---+
      ROOT    |       | 0 | xxe6
      +---+   |       +---+
 xxxx | 0 | shortcut  :   : xxe6
      +---+   |       +---+
 xxe6 :   :   |       |   | xxe6
      +---+   |       +---+
      | 6 |---+       :   : xxe6
      +---+           +---+
 xxe6 :   :           | f | xxe6
      +---+           +---+
 xxe6 | f |
      +---+

4. As mentioned above, If a slot(slot 6) of the root points to a shortcut,
   it may be mistakenly transferred to a key*, leading to a read
   out-of-bounds read.

To fix this issue, one should jump to descend_to_node if the ptr is a
shortcut, regardless of whether the node is root or not.

So rq_qos_wake_function() calls wake_up_process(data->task), which calls
try_to_wake_up(), which faults in raw_spin_lock_irqsave(&p->pi_lock).

p comes from data->task, and data comes from the waitqueue entry, which
is stored on the waiter's stack in rq_qos_wait(). Analyzing the core
dump with drgn, I found that the waiter had already woken up and moved
on to a completely unrelated code path, clobbering what was previously
data->task. Meanwhile, the waker was passing the clobbered garbage in
data->task to wake_up_process(), leading to the crash.

What's happening is that in between rq_qos_wake_function() deleting the
waitqueue entry and calling wake_up_process(), rq_qos_wait() is finding
that it already got a token and returning. The race looks like this:

rq_qos_wait()                           rq_qos_wake_function()
==============================================================
prepare_to_wait_exclusive()
                                        data->got_token = true;
                                        list_del_init(&curr->entry);
if (data.got_token)
        break;
finish_wait(&rqw->wait, &data.wq);
  ^- returns immediately because
     list_empty_careful(&wq_entry->entry)
     is true
... return, go do something else ...
                                        wake_up_process(data->task)
                                          (NO LONGER VALID!)-^

Normally, finish_wait() is supposed to synchronize against the waker.
But, as noted above, it is returning immediately because the waitqueue
entry has already been removed from the waitqueue.

The bug is that rq_qos_wake_function() is accessing the waitqueue entry
AFTER deleting it. Note that autoremove_wake_function() wakes the waiter
and THEN deletes the waitqueue entry, which is the proper order.

Fix it by swapping the order. We also need to use
list_del_init_careful() to match the list_empty_careful() in
finish_wait().",'-,4.7,6021727,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7293-1),5,5,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 26, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,223969342,ptdtc-sv-klmsq2.portugal.pt,10.200.5.150,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:a2a1,Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7293-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7293-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,30,4,"Feb 26, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",Ubuntu,CRITICAL,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 20.04.6,'-,'-,26,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,249,,"#table cols=""3""

KVM: Fix a data race on last_boosted_vcpu in kvm_vcpu_on_spin()

Use {READ,WRITE}_ONCE() to access kvm->last_boosted_vcpu to ensure the

compiler tears the stores, it's theoretically possible for KVM to attempt
to get a vCPU using an out-of-bounds index, e.g. if the write is split
into multiple 8-bit stores, and is paired with a 32-bit load on a VM with
257 vCPUs:

  CPU0                              CPU1
  last_boosted_vcpu = 0xff;

CVE-2024-47742,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

firmware_loader: Block path traversal

Most firmware names are hardcoded strings, or are constructed from fairly
constrained format strings where the dynamic parts are just some hex
numbers or such.

However, there are a couple codepaths in the kernel where firmware file
names contain string components that are passed through from a device or
semi-privileged userspace; the ones I could find (not counting interfaces
that require root privileges) are:

 - lpfc_sli4_request_firmware_update() seems to construct the firmware
   filename from ""ModelName"", a string that was previously parsed out of
   some descriptor (""Vital Product Data"") in lpfc_fill_vpd()
 - nfp_net_fw_find() seems to construct a firmware filename from a model
   name coming from nfp_hwinfo_lookup(pf->hwinfo, ""nffw.partno""), which I
   think parses some descriptor that was read from the device.
   (But this case likely isn't exploitable because the format string looks
   like ""netronome/nic_%s"", and there shouldn't be any *folders* starting
   with ""netronome/nic_"". The previous case was different because there,
   the ""%s"" is *at the start* of the format string.)
 - module_flash_fw_schedule() is reachable from the
   ETHTOOL_MSG_MODULE_FW_FLASH_ACT netlink command, which is marked as
   GENL_UNS_ADMIN_PERM (meaning CAP_NET_ADMIN inside a user namespace is
   enough to pass the privilege check), and takes a userspace-provided
   firmware name.
   (But I think to reach this case, you need to have CAP_NET_ADMIN over a
   network namespace that a special kind of ethernet device is mapped into,
   so I think this is not a viable attack path in practice.)

Fix it by rejecting any firmware names containing "".."" path components.

wifi: iwlegacy: Clear stale interrupts before resuming device

iwl4965 fails upon resume from hibernation on my laptop. The reason
seems to be a stale interrupt which isn't being cleared out before

trying to bring things back up, and the restart work (queued form
the interrupt handler) trying to bring things down. Eventually
the whole thing blows up.

Fix the problem by clearing out any stale interrupts before
interrupts get enabled during resume.

CVE-2024-50195,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

posix-clock: Fix missing timespec64 check in pc_clock_settime()

As Andrew pointed out, it will make sense that the PTP core
checked timespec64 struct's tv_sec and tv_nsec range before calling
ptp->info->settime64().

As the man manual of clock_settime() said, if tp.tv_sec is negative or
tp.tv_nsec is outside the range [0..999,999,999], it should return EINVAL,
which include dynamic clocks which handles PTP clock, and the condition is
consistent with timespec64_valid(). As Thomas suggested, timespec64_valid()
only check the timespec is valid, but not ensure that the time is
in a valid range, so check it ahead using timespec64_valid_strict()
in pc_clock_settime() and return -EINVAL if not valid.

There are some drivers that use tp->tv_sec and tp->tv_nsec directly to
write registers without validity checks and assume that the higher layer
has checked it, which is dangerous and will benefit from this, such as
hclge_ptp_settime(), igb_ptp_settime_i210(), _rcar_gen4_ptp_settime(),
and some drivers can remove the checks of itself.",'-,5.5,6021727,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7293-1),5,5,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 26, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,223969342,ptdtc-sv-klmsq2.portugal.pt,10.200.5.150,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:a2a1,Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7293-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7293-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,30,4,"Feb 26, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",Ubuntu,CRITICAL,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 20.04.6,'-,'-,26,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,249,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-50006,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: fix i_data_sem unlock order in ext4_ind_migrate()

Fuzzing reports a possible deadlock in jbd2_log_wait_commit.

This issue is triggered when an EXT4_IOC_MIGRATE ioctl is set to require
synchronous updates because the file descriptor is opened with O_SYNC.
This can lead to the jbd2_journal_stop() function calling
jbd2_might_wait_for_commit(), potentially causing a deadlock if the
EXT4_IOC_MIGRATE call races with a write(2) system call.

This problem only arises when CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING is enabled. In this
case, the jbd2_might_wait_for_commit macro locks jbd2_handle in the
jbd2_journal_stop function while i_data_sem is locked. This triggers
lockdep because the jbd2_journal_start function might also lock the same

wifi: ath9k_htc: Use __skb_set_length() for resetting urb before resubmit

Syzbot points out that skb_trim() has a sanity check on the existing length of

clearly just to reset the length to zero before resubmitting, so switch to
calling __skb_set_length(skb, 0) directly. In addition, __skb_set_length()
already contains a call to skb_reset_tail_pointer(), so remove the redundant

CVE-2024-9143,"Issue summary: Use of the low-level GF(2^m) elliptic curve APIs with untrusted
explicit values for the field polynomial can lead to out-of-bounds memory reads
or writes.

Impact summary: Out of bound memory writes can lead to an application crash or
even a possibility of a remote code execution, however, in all the protocols
involving Elliptic Curve Cryptography that we're aware of, either only ""named
curves"" are supported, or, if explicit curve parameters are supported, they
specify an X9.62 encoding of binary (GF(2^m)) curves that can't represent
problematic input values. Thus the likelihood of existence of a vulnerable
application is low.

In particular, the X9.62 encoding is used for ECC keys in X.509 certificates,
so problematic inputs cannot occur in the context of processing X.509
certificates.  Any problematic use-cases would have to be using an ""exotic""
curve encoding.

The affected APIs include: EC_GROUP_new_curve_GF2m(), EC_GROUP_new_from_params(),
and various supporting BN_GF2m_*() functions.

Applications working with ""exotic"" explicit binary (GF(2^m)) curve parameters,
that make it possible to represent invalid field polynomials with a zero
constant term, via the above or similar APIs, may terminate abruptly as a
result of reading or writing outside of array bounds.  Remote code execution
cannot easily be ruled out.

CVE-2024-9143,"Issue summary: Use of the low-level GF(2^m) elliptic curve APIs with untrusted
explicit values for the field polynomial can lead to out-of-bounds memory reads
or writes.

Impact summary: Out of bound memory writes can lead to an application crash or
even a possibility of a remote code execution, however, in all the protocols
involving Elliptic Curve Cryptography that we're aware of, either only ""named
curves"" are supported, or, if explicit curve parameters are supported, they
specify an X9.62 encoding of binary (GF(2^m)) curves that can't represent
problematic input values. Thus the likelihood of existence of a vulnerable
application is low.

In particular, the X9.62 encoding is used for ECC keys in X.509 certificates,
so problematic inputs cannot occur in the context of processing X.509
certificates.  Any problematic use-cases would have to be using an ""exotic""
curve encoding.

The affected APIs include: EC_GROUP_new_curve_GF2m(), EC_GROUP_new_from_params(),
and various supporting BN_GF2m_*() functions.

Applications working with ""exotic"" explicit binary (GF(2^m)) curve parameters,
that make it possible to represent invalid field polynomials with a zero
constant term, via the above or similar APIs, may terminate abruptly as a
result of reading or writing outside of array bounds.  Remote code execution
cannot easily be ruled out.

CVE-2024-53052,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

io_uring/rw: fix missing NOWAIT check for O_DIRECT start write

When io_uring starts a write, it'll call kiocb_start_write() to bump the
super block rwsem, preventing any freezes from happening while that
write is in-flight. The freeze side will grab that rwsem for writing,
excluding any new writers from happening and waiting for existing writes
to finish. But io_uring unconditionally uses kiocb_start_write(), which
will block if someone is currently attempting to freeze the mount point.
This causes a deadlock where freeze is waiting for previous writes to
complete, but the previous writes cannot complete, as the task that is
supposed to complete them is blocked waiting on starting a new write.
This results in the following stuck trace showing that dependency with
the write blocked starting a new write:

where IOCB_NOWAIT would always be set, this returns -EAGAIN which will
have io_uring core issue a blocking attempt of the write. That will in
turn also get completions run, ensuring forward progress.

CVE-2024-50182,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

secretmem: disable memfd_secret() if arch cannot set direct map

Return -ENOSYS from memfd_secret() syscall if !can_set_direct_map().  This
is the case for example on some arm64 configurations, where marking 4k
PTEs in the direct map not present can only be done if the direct map is
set up at 4k granularity in the first place (as ARM's break-before-make
semantics do not easily allow breaking apart large/gigantic pages).

More precisely, on arm64 systems with !can_set_direct_map(),
set_direct_map_invalid_noflush() is a no-op, however it returns success
(0) instead of an error.  This means that memfd_secret will seemingly
""work"" (e.g.  syscall succeeds, you can mmap the fd and fault in pages),
but it does not actually achieve its goal of removing its memory from the
direct map.

Note that with this patch, memfd_secret() will start erroring on systems
where can_set_direct_map() returns false (arm64 with
CONFIG_RODATA_FULL_DEFAULT_ENABLED=n, CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC=n and
CONFIG_KFENCE=n), but that still seems better than the current silent
failure.  Since CONFIG_RODATA_FULL_DEFAULT_ENABLED defaults to 'y', most
arm64 systems actually have a working memfd_secret() and aren't be
affected.

From going through the iterations of the original memfd_secret patch
series, it seems that disabling the syscall in these scenarios was the
intended behavior [1] (preferred over having
set_direct_map_invalid_noflush return an error as that would result in
SIGBUSes at page-fault time), however the check for it got dropped between
v16 [2] and v17 [3], when secretmem moved away from CMA allocations.

CVE-2024-41066,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ibmvnic: Add tx check to prevent skb leak

Below is a summary of how the driver stores a reference to an skb during
transmit:
    tx_buff[free_map[consumer_index]]->skb = new_skb;
    free_map[consumer_index] = IBMVNIC_INVALID_MAP;
    consumer_index ++;
Where variable data looks like this:
    free_map == [4, IBMVNIC_INVALID_MAP, IBMVNIC_INVALID_MAP, 0, 3]
                                               	consumer_index^
    tx_buff == [skb=null, skb=<ptr>, skb=<ptr>, skb=null, skb=null]

The driver has checks to ensure that free_map[consumer_index] pointed to
a valid index but there was no check to ensure that this index pointed
to an unused/null skb address. So, if, by some chance, our free_map and
tx_buff lists become out of sync then we were previously risking an
skb memory leak. This could then cause tcp congestion control to stop
sending packets, eventually leading to ETIMEDOUT.

Therefore, add a conditional to ensure that the skb address is null. If
not then warn the user (because this is still a bug that should be
patched) and free the old pointer to prevent memleak/tcp problems.",'-,5.5,6021689,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7288-1),4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 26, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,197470777,demo-linux2ad-6.portugal.pt,10.208.230.182,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feba:9f8b,Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7288-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7288-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,30,4,"Feb 25, 2025","Feb 24, 2025",Ubuntu,HIGH,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 22.04.5,'-,'-,13,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,237,,"#table cols=""3""

media: dvbdev: prevent the risk of out of memory access

The dvbdev contains a static variable used to store dvb minors.

The behavior of it depends if CONFIG_DVB_DYNAMIC_MINORS is set
or not. When not set, dvb_register_device() won't check for
boundaries, as it will rely that a previous call to
dvb_register_adapter() would already be enforcing it.

On a similar way, dvb_device_open() uses the assumption
that the register functions already did the needed checks.

calls. This also generate warnings on static check analysers
like Coverity.

CVE-2024-50194,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64: probes: Fix uprobes for big-endian kernels

The arm64 uprobes code is broken for big-endian kernels as it doesn't
convert the in-memory instruction encoding (which is always
little-endian) into the kernel's native endianness before analyzing and
simulating instructions. This may result in a few distinct problems:

* The kernel may may erroneously reject probing an instruction which can
  safely be probed.

* The kernel may erroneously erroneously permit stepping an
  instruction out-of-line when that instruction cannot be stepped
  out-of-line safely.

* The kernel may erroneously simulate instruction incorrectly dur to
  interpretting the byte-swapped encoding.

The endianness mismatch isn't caught by the compiler or sparse because:

* The arch_uprobe::{insn,ixol} fields are encoded as arrays of u8, so
  the compiler and sparse have no idea these contain a little-endian
  32-bit value. The core uprobes code populates these with a memcpy()
  which similarly does not handle endianness.

* While the uprobe_opcode_t type is an alias for __le32, both
  arch_uprobe_analyze_insn() and arch_uprobe_skip_sstep() cast from u8[]
  to the similarly-named probe_opcode_t, which is an alias for u32.
  Hence there is no endianness conversion warning.

Fix this by changing the arch_uprobe::{insn,ixol} fields to __le32 and
adding the appropriate __le32_to_cpu() conversions prior to consuming
the instruction encoding. The core uprobes copies these fields as opaque
ranges of bytes, and so is unaffected by this change.

At the same time, remove MAX_UINSN_BYTES and consistently use
AARCH64_INSN_SIZE for clarity.

CVE-2024-50229,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nilfs2: fix potential deadlock with newly created symlinks

Syzbot reported that page_symlink(), called by nilfs_symlink(), triggers
memory reclamation involving the filesystem layer, which can result in
circular lock dependencies among the reader/writer semaphore
nilfs->ns_segctor_sem, s_writers percpu_rwsem (intwrite) and the
fs_reclaim pseudo lock.

This is because after commit 21fc61c73c39 (""don't put symlink bodies in
pagecache into highmem""), the gfp flags of the page cache for symbolic
links are overwritten to GFP_KERNEL via inode_nohighmem().

This is not a problem for symlinks read from the backing device, because
the __GFP_FS flag is dropped after inode_nohighmem() is called.  However,
when a new symlink is created with nilfs_symlink(), the gfp flags remain
overwritten to GFP_KERNEL.  Then, memory allocation called from
page_symlink() etc.  triggers memory reclamation including the FS layer,
which may call nilfs_evict_inode() or nilfs_dirty_inode().  And these can
cause a deadlock if they are called while nilfs->ns_segctor_sem is held:

Fix this issue by dropping the __GFP_FS flag from the page cache GFP flags
of newly created symlinks in the same way that nilfs_new_inode() and
__nilfs_read_inode() do, as a workaround until we adopt nofs allocation
scope consistently or improve the locking constraints.",'-,5.5,6021689,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7288-1),4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 26, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,197470777,demo-linux2ad-6.portugal.pt,10.208.230.182,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feba:9f8b,Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7288-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7288-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,30,4,"Feb 25, 2025","Feb 24, 2025",Ubuntu,HIGH,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 22.04.5,'-,'-,13,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,237,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-53058,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: stmmac: TSO: Fix unbalanced DMA map/unmap for non-paged SKB data

In case the non-paged data of a SKB carries protocol header and protocol
payload to be transmitted on a certain platform that the DMA AXI address
width is configured to 40-bit/48-bit, or the size of the non-paged data
is bigger than TSO_MAX_BUFF_SIZE on a certain platform that the DMA AXI
address width is configured to 32-bit, then this SKB requires at least
two DMA transmit descriptors to serve it.

For example, three descriptors are allocated to split one DMA buffer
mapped from one piece of non-paged data:
    dma_desc[N + 0],
    dma_desc[N + 1],
    dma_desc[N + 2].
Then three elements of tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[] will be allocated to hold
extra information to be reused in stmmac_tx_clean():
    tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[N + 0],
    tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[N + 1],
    tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[N + 2].
Now we focus on tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[entry].buf, which is the DMA buffer
address returned by DMA mapping call. stmmac_tx_clean() will try to
unmap the DMA buffer _ONLY_IF_ tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[entry].buf
is a valid buffer address.

The expected behavior that saves DMA buffer address of this non-paged
data to tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[entry].buf is:
    tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[N + 0].buf = NULL;
    tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[N + 1].buf = NULL;
    tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[N + 2].buf = dma_map_single();
Unfortunately, the current code misbehaves like this:
    tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[N + 0].buf = dma_map_single();
    tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[N + 1].buf = NULL;
    tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[N + 2].buf = NULL;

On the stmmac_tx_clean() side, when dma_desc[N + 0] is closed by the
DMA engine, tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[N + 0].buf is a valid buffer address
obviously, then the DMA buffer will be unmapped immediately.
There may be a rare case that the DMA engine does not finish the
pending dma_desc[N + 1], dma_desc[N + 2] yet. Now things will go
horribly wrong, DMA is going to access a unmapped/unreferenced memory
region, corrupted data will be transmited or iommu fault will be
triggered :(

In contrast, the for-loop that maps SKB fragments behaves perfectly
as expected, and that is how the driver should do for both non-paged
data and paged frags actually.

This patch corrects DMA map/unmap sequences by fixing the array index
for tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[entry].buf when assigning DMA buffer address.

_does_ have code to try to handle it with:

  if (*reg)

a noop. The code then goes on to dereference `dump_addr`.

Make the function print ""Registers not stored"" when it sees a NULL to
solve this. Since we're touching the code, fix
msm_disp_state_print_regs() not to pointlessly take a double-pointer

CVE-2024-50278,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dm cache: fix potential out-of-bounds access on the first resume

Out-of-bounds access occurs if the fast device is expanded unexpectedly
before the first-time resume of the cache table. This happens because
expanding the fast device requires reloading the cache table for
cache_create to allocate new in-core data structures that fit the new
size, and the check in cache_preresume is not performed during the
first resume, leading to the issue.

Reproduce steps:

1. prepare component devices:

dmsetup create cmeta --table ""0 8192 linear /dev/sdc 0""
dmsetup create cdata --table ""0 65536 linear /dev/sdc 8192""
dmsetup create corig --table ""0 524288 linear /dev/sdc 262144""
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/mapper/cmeta bs=4k count=1 oflag=direct

2. load a cache table of 512 cache blocks, and deliberately expand the
   fast device before resuming the cache, making the in-core data
   structures inadequate.

dmsetup create cache --notable
dmsetup reload cache --table ""0 524288 cache /dev/mapper/cmeta \
/dev/mapper/cdata /dev/mapper/corig 128 2 metadata2 writethrough smq 0""
dmsetup reload cdata --table ""0 131072 linear /dev/sdc 8192""
dmsetup resume cdata
dmsetup resume cache

3. suspend the cache to write out the in-core dirty bitset and hint
   array, leading to out-of-bounds access to the dirty bitset at offset
   0x40:

dmsetup suspend cache

CVE-2024-50273,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: reinitialize delayed ref list after deleting it from the list

At insert_delayed_ref() if we need to update the action of an existing
ref to BTRFS_DROP_DELAYED_REF, we delete the ref from its ref head's
ref_add_list using list_del(), which leaves the ref's add_list member
not reinitialized, as list_del() sets the next and prev members of the
list to LIST_POISON1 and LIST_POISON2, respectively.

If later we end up calling drop_delayed_ref() against the ref, which can
happen during merging or when destroying delayed refs due to a transaction
abort, we can trigger a crash since at drop_delayed_ref() we call
list_empty() against the ref's add_list, which returns false since
the list was not reinitialized after the list_del() and as a consequence
we call list_del() again at drop_delayed_ref(). This results in an
invalid list access since the next and prev members are set to poison
pointers, resulting in a splat if CONFIG_LIST_HARDENED and
CONFIG_DEBUG_LIST are set or invalid poison pointer dereferences
otherwise.

So fix this by deleting from the list with list_del_init() instead.",'-,5.5,6021689,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7288-1),4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 26, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,197470777,demo-linux2ad-6.portugal.pt,10.208.230.182,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feba:9f8b,Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7288-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7288-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,'-,4,"Feb 25, 2025","Feb 24, 2025",Ubuntu,HIGH,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 22.04.5,'-,'-,13,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,237,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-50154,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tcp/dccp: Don't use timer_pending() in reqsk_queue_unlink().

Martin KaFai Lau reported use-after-free [0] in reqsk_timer_handler().

  """"""
  We are seeing a use-after-free from a bpf prog attached to
  trace_tcp_retransmit_synack. The program passes the req->sk to the
  bpf_sk_storage_get_tracing kernel helper which does check for null
  before using it.
  """"""

The commit 83fccfc3940c (""inet: fix potential deadlock in
reqsk_queue_unlink()"") added timer_pending() in reqsk_queue_unlink() not
to call del_timer_sync() from reqsk_timer_handler(), but it introduced a
small race window.

Before the timer is called, expire_timers() calls detach_timer(timer, true)
to clear timer->entry.pprev and marks it as not pending.

If reqsk_queue_unlink() checks timer_pending() just after expire_timers()
calls detach_timer(), TCP will miss del_timer_sync(); the reqsk timer will
continue running and send multiple SYN+ACKs until it expires.

The reported UAF could happen if req->sk is close()d earlier than the timer
expiration, which is 63s by default.

The scenario would be

  1. inet_csk_complete_hashdance() calls inet_csk_reqsk_queue_drop(),
     but del_timer_sync() is missed

  2. reqsk timer is executed and scheduled again

  3. req->sk is accept()ed and reqsk_put() decrements rsk_refcnt, but
     reqsk timer still has another one, and inet_csk_accept() does not
     clear req->sk for non-TFO sockets

  4. sk is close()d

  5. reqsk timer is executed again, and BPF touches req->sk

Let's not use timer_pending() by passing the caller context to
__inet_csk_reqsk_queue_drop().

Note that reqsk timer is pinned, so the issue does not happen in most
use cases. [1]

nilfs2: propagate directory read errors from nilfs_find_entry()

Syzbot reported that a task hang occurs in vcs_open() during a fuzzing
test for nilfs2.

The root cause of this problem is that in nilfs_find_entry(), which
searches for directory entries, ignores errors when loading a directory
page/folio via nilfs_get_folio() fails.

If the filesystem images is corrupted, and the i_size of the directory
inode is large, and the directory page/folio is successfully read but
fails the sanity check, for example when it is zero-filled,
nilfs_check_folio() may continue to spit out error messages in bursts.

Fix this issue by propagating the error to the callers when loading a
page/folio fails in nilfs_find_entry().

The current interface of nilfs_find_entry() and its callers is outdated
and cannot propagate error codes such as -EIO and -ENOMEM returned via
nilfs_find_entry(), so fix it together.",'-,5.5,6021689,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7288-1),4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 26, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,197470777,demo-linux2ad-6.portugal.pt,10.208.230.182,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feba:9f8b,Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7288-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7288-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,30,4,"Feb 25, 2025","Feb 24, 2025",Ubuntu,HIGH,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 22.04.5,'-,'-,13,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,237,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-50162,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: devmap: provide rxq after redirect

rxq contains a pointer to the device from where
the redirect happened. Currently, the BPF program
that was executed after a redirect via BPF_MAP_TYPE_DEVMAP*
does not have it set.

This is particularly bad since accessing ingress_ifindex, e.g.

SEC(""xdp"")
int prog(struct xdp_md *pkt)
{
        return bpf_redirect_map(&dev_redirect_map, 0, 0);
}

SEC(""xdp/devmap"")
int prog_after_redirect(struct xdp_md *pkt)
{
        bpf_printk(""ifindex %i"", pkt->ingress_ifindex);
        return XDP_PASS;
}

depends on access to rxq, so a NULL pointer gets dereferenced:

CVE-2024-50163,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Make sure internal and UAPI bpf_redirect flags don't overlap

The bpf_redirect_info is shared between the SKB and XDP redirect paths,
and the two paths use the same numeric flag values in the ri->flags
field (specifically, BPF_F_BROADCAST == BPF_F_NEXTHOP). This means that
if skb bpf_redirect_neigh() is used with a non-NULL params argument and,
subsequently, an XDP redirect is performed using the same
bpf_redirect_info struct, the XDP path will get confused and end up
crashing, which syzbot managed to trigger.

With the stack-allocated bpf_redirect_info, the structure is no longer
shared between the SKB and XDP paths, so the crash doesn't happen
anymore. However, different code paths using identically-numbered flag
values in the same struct field still seems like a bit of a mess, so
this patch cleans that up by moving the flag definitions together and
redefining the three flags in BPF_F_REDIRECT_INTERNAL to not overlap
with the flags used for XDP. It also adds a BUILD_BUG_ON() check to make
sure the overlap is not re-introduced by mistake.",'-,5.5,6021689,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7288-1),4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 26, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,197470777,demo-linux2ad-6.portugal.pt,10.208.230.182,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feba:9f8b,Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7288-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7288-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,'-,4,"Feb 25, 2025","Feb 24, 2025",Ubuntu,HIGH,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 22.04.5,'-,'-,13,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,237,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-53097,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm: krealloc: Fix MTE false alarm in __do_krealloc

This patch addresses an issue introduced by commit 1a83a716ec233 (""mm:
krealloc: consider spare memory for __GFP_ZERO"") which causes MTE
(Memory Tagging Extension) to falsely report a slab-out-of-bounds error.

The problem occurs when zeroing out spare memory in __do_krealloc. The
original code only considered software-based KASAN and did not account
for MTE. It does not reset the KASAN tag before calling memset, leading
to a mismatch between the pointer tag and the memory tag, resulting
in a false positive.

CVE-2024-53088,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

i40e: fix race condition by adding filter's intermediate sync state

Fix a race condition in the i40e driver that leads to MAC/VLAN filters
becoming corrupted and leaking. Address the issue that occurs under
heavy load when multiple threads are concurrently modifying MAC/VLAN
filters by setting mac and port VLAN.

1. Thread T0 allocates a filter in i40e_add_filter() within
        i40e_ndo_set_vf_port_vlan().
2. Thread T1 concurrently frees the filter in __i40e_del_filter() within
        i40e_ndo_set_vf_mac().
3. Subsequently, i40e_service_task() calls i40e_sync_vsi_filters(), which
        refers to the already freed filter memory, causing corruption.

Reproduction steps:
1. Spawn multiple VFs.
2. Apply a concurrent heavy load by running parallel operations to change
        MAC addresses on the VFs and change port VLANs on the host.
3. Observe errors in dmesg:
""Error I40E_AQ_RC_ENOSPC adding RX filters on VF XX,
	please set promiscuous on manually for VF XX"".

Exact code for stable reproduction Intel can't open-source now.

The fix involves implementing a new intermediate filter state,
I40E_FILTER_NEW_SYNC, for the time when a filter is on a tmp_add_list.

must be removed using the full process.",'-,4.7,6021689,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7288-1),4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 26, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,197470777,demo-linux2ad-6.portugal.pt,10.208.230.182,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feba:9f8b,Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7288-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7288-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,'-,4,"Feb 25, 2025","Feb 24, 2025",Ubuntu,HIGH,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 22.04.5,'-,'-,13,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,237,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-50010,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

exec: don't WARN for racy path_noexec check

Both i_mode and noexec checks wrapped in WARN_ON stem from an artifact
of the previous implementation. They used to legitimately check for the
condition, but that got moved up in two commits:
633fb6ac3980 (""exec: move S_ISREG() check earlier"")
0fd338b2d2cd (""exec: move path_noexec() check earlier"")

Instead of being removed said checks are WARN_ON'ed instead, which
has some debug value.

However, the spurious path_noexec check is racy, resulting in
unwarranted warnings should someone race with setting the noexec flag.

One can note there is more to perm-checking whether execve is allowed
and none of the conditions are guaranteed to still hold after they were
tested for.

Additionally this does not validate whether the code path did any perm
checking to begin with -- it will pass if the inode happens to be
regular.

Keep the redundant path_noexec() check even though it's mindless
nonsense checking for guarantee that isn't given so drop the WARN.

Reword the commentary and do small tidy ups while here.

CVE-2024-50099,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64: probes: Remove broken LDR (literal) uprobe support

The simulate_ldr_literal() and simulate_ldrsw_literal() functions are
unsafe to use for uprobes. Both functions were originally written for
use with kprobes, and access memory with plain C accesses. When uprobes
was added, these were reused unmodified even though they cannot safely
access user memory.

There are three key problems:

1) The plain C accesses do not have corresponding extable entries, and
   thus if they encounter a fault the kernel will treat these as
   unintentional accesses to user memory, resulting in a BUG() which
   will kill the kernel thread, and likely lead to further issues (e.g.
   lockup or panic()).

2) The plain C accesses are subject to HW PAN and SW PAN, and so when
   either is in use, any attempt to simulate an access to user memory
   will fault. Thus neither simulate_ldr_literal() nor
   simulate_ldrsw_literal() can do anything useful when simulating a
   user instruction on any system with HW PAN or SW PAN.

3) The plain C accesses are privileged, as they run in kernel context,
   and in practice can access a small range of kernel virtual addresses.
   The instructions they simulate have a range of +/-1MiB, and since the
   simulated instructions must itself be a user instructions in the
   TTBR0 address range, these can address the final 1MiB of the TTBR1
   acddress range by wrapping downwards from an address in the first
   1MiB of the TTBR0 address range.

   In contemporary kernels the last 8MiB of TTBR1 address range is
   reserved, and accesses to this will always fault, meaning this is no
   worse than (1).

   Historically, it was theoretically possible for the linear map or
   vmemmap to spill into the final 8MiB of the TTBR1 address range, but
   in practice this is extremely unlikely to occur as this would
   require either:

   * Having enough physical memory to fill the entire linear map all the
     way to the final 1MiB of the TTBR1 address range.

   * Getting unlucky with KASLR randomization of the linear map such
     that the populated region happens to overlap with the last 1MiB of
     the TTBR address range.

   ... and in either case if we were to spill into the final page there
   would be larger problems as the final page would alias with error
   pointers.

Practically speaking, (1) and (2) are the big issues. Given there have
been no reports of problems since the broken code was introduced, it
appears that no-one is relying on probing these instructions with
uprobes.

Avoid these issues by not allowing uprobes on LDR (literal) and LDRSW
(literal), limiting the use of simulate_ldr_literal() and
simulate_ldrsw_literal() to kprobes. Attempts to place uprobes on LDR
(literal) and LDRSW (literal) will be rejected as
arm_probe_decode_insn() will return INSN_REJECTED. In future we can
consider introducing working uprobes support for these instructions, but
this will require more significant work.",'-,5.5,6021689,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7288-1),4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 26, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,197470777,demo-linux2ad-6.portugal.pt,10.208.230.182,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feba:9f8b,Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7288-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7288-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,30,4,"Feb 25, 2025","Feb 24, 2025",Ubuntu,HIGH,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 22.04.5,'-,'-,13,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,237,,"#table cols=""3""

'ocfs2_xa_remove_entry(loc);' twice:

This issue was also reported by syzbot.

It can be reproduced by following these steps(more details [1]):
1. Obtain more than 32 inputs that have similar hashes, which ends with the
   pattern '0xxxxxxxe6'.
2. Reboot and add the keys obtained in step 1.

The reproducer demonstrates how this issue happened:
1. In the search_nested_keyrings function, when it iterates through the
   slots in a node(below tag ascend_to_node), if the slot pointer is meta
   and node->back_pointer != NULL(it means a root), it will proceed to
   descend_to_node. However, there is an exception. If node is the root,
   and one of the slots points to a shortcut, it will be treated as a
   keyring.
2. Whether the ptr is keyring decided by keyring_ptr_is_keyring function.
   However, KEYRING_PTR_SUBTYPE is 0x2UL, the same as
   ASSOC_ARRAY_PTR_SUBTYPE_MASK.
3. When 32 keys with the similar hashes are added to the tree, the ROOT
   has keys with hashes that are not similar (e.g. slot 0) and it splits
   NODE A without using a shortcut. When NODE A is filled with keys that
   all hashes are xxe6, the keys are similar, NODE A will split with a
   shortcut. Finally, it forms the tree as shown below, where slot 6 points
   to a shortcut.

                      NODE A
              +------>+---+
      ROOT    |       | 0 | xxe6
      +---+   |       +---+
 xxxx | 0 | shortcut  :   : xxe6
      +---+   |       +---+
 xxe6 :   :   |       |   | xxe6
      +---+   |       +---+
      | 6 |---+       :   : xxe6
      +---+           +---+
 xxe6 :   :           | f | xxe6
      +---+           +---+
 xxe6 | f |
      +---+

4. As mentioned above, If a slot(slot 6) of the root points to a shortcut,
   it may be mistakenly transferred to a key*, leading to a read
   out-of-bounds read.

To fix this issue, one should jump to descend_to_node if the ptr is a
shortcut, regardless of whether the node is root or not.

CVE-2024-50141,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ACPI: PRM: Find EFI_MEMORY_RUNTIME block for PRM handler and context

PRMT needs to find the correct type of block to translate the PA-VA
mapping for EFI runtime services.

The issue arises because the PRMT is finding a block of type
EFI_CONVENTIONAL_MEMORY, which is not appropriate for runtime services
as described in Section 2.2.2 (Runtime Services) of the UEFI
Specification [1]. Since the PRM handler is a type of runtime service,
this causes an exception when the PRM handler is called.

    [Firmware Bug]: Unable to handle paging request in EFI runtime service
    WARNING: CPU: 22 PID: 4330 at drivers/firmware/efi/runtime-wrappers.c:341
        __efi_queue_work+0x11c/0x170
    Call trace:

Let PRMT find a block with EFI_MEMORY_RUNTIME for PRM handler and PRM
context.

If no suitable block is found, a warning message will be printed, but
the procedure continues to manage the next PRM handler.

However, if the PRM handler is actually called without proper allocation,
it would result in a failure during error handling.

By using the correct memory types for runtime services, ensure that the
PRM handler and the context are properly mapped in the virtual address
space during runtime, preventing the paging request error.

The issue is really that only memory that has been remapped for runtime
by the firmware can be used by the PRM handler, and so the region needs
to have the EFI_MEMORY_RUNTIME attribute.

So rq_qos_wake_function() calls wake_up_process(data->task), which calls
try_to_wake_up(), which faults in raw_spin_lock_irqsave(&p->pi_lock).

p comes from data->task, and data comes from the waitqueue entry, which
is stored on the waiter's stack in rq_qos_wait(). Analyzing the core
dump with drgn, I found that the waiter had already woken up and moved
on to a completely unrelated code path, clobbering what was previously
data->task. Meanwhile, the waker was passing the clobbered garbage in
data->task to wake_up_process(), leading to the crash.

What's happening is that in between rq_qos_wake_function() deleting the
waitqueue entry and calling wake_up_process(), rq_qos_wait() is finding
that it already got a token and returning. The race looks like this:

rq_qos_wait()                           rq_qos_wake_function()
==============================================================
prepare_to_wait_exclusive()
                                        data->got_token = true;
                                        list_del_init(&curr->entry);
if (data.got_token)
        break;
finish_wait(&rqw->wait, &data.wq);
  ^- returns immediately because
     list_empty_careful(&wq_entry->entry)
     is true
... return, go do something else ...
                                        wake_up_process(data->task)
                                          (NO LONGER VALID!)-^

Normally, finish_wait() is supposed to synchronize against the waker.
But, as noted above, it is returning immediately because the waitqueue
entry has already been removed from the waitqueue.

The bug is that rq_qos_wake_function() is accessing the waitqueue entry
AFTER deleting it. Note that autoremove_wake_function() wakes the waiter
and THEN deletes the waitqueue entry, which is the proper order.

Fix it by swapping the order. We also need to use
list_del_init_careful() to match the list_empty_careful() in
finish_wait().",'-,4.7,6021689,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7288-1),4,4,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 26, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,197470777,demo-linux2ad-6.portugal.pt,10.208.230.182,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feba:9f8b,Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7288-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7288-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,30,4,"Feb 25, 2025","Feb 24, 2025",Ubuntu,HIGH,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 22.04.5,'-,'-,13,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,237,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-40953,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: Fix a data race on last_boosted_vcpu in kvm_vcpu_on_spin()

Use {READ,WRITE}_ONCE() to access kvm->last_boosted_vcpu to ensure the
loads and stores are atomic.  In the extremely unlikely scenario the
compiler tears the stores, it's theoretically possible for KVM to attempt
to get a vCPU using an out-of-bounds index, e.g. if the write is split
into multiple 8-bit stores, and is paired with a 32-bit load on a VM with
257 vCPUs:

  CPU0                              CPU1
  last_boosted_vcpu = 0xff;

                                    (last_boosted_vcpu = 0x100)
                                    last_boosted_vcpu[15:8] = 0x01;
  i = (last_boosted_vcpu = 0x1ff)
                                    last_boosted_vcpu[7:0] = 0x00;

  vcpu = kvm->vcpu_array[0x1ff];

CVE-2024-50115,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: nSVM: Ignore nCR3[4:0] when loading PDPTEs from memory

Ignore nCR3[4:0] when loading PDPTEs from memory for nested SVM, as bits
4:0 of CR3 are ignored when PAE paging is used, and thus VMRUN doesn't
enforce 32-byte alignment of nCR3.

In the absolute worst case scenario, failure to ignore bits 4:0 can result
in an out-of-bounds read, e.g. if the target page is at the end of a
memslot, and the VMM isn't using guard pages.

Per the APM:

  The CR3 register points to the base address of the page-directory-pointer
  table. The page-directory-pointer table is aligned on a 32-byte boundary,
  with the low 5 address bits 4:0 assumed to be 0.

And the SDM's much more explicit:

  4:0    Ignored

Note, KVM gets this right when loading PDPTRs, it's only the nSVM flow

Syzbot reported that after nilfs2 reads a corrupted file system image

This is because the buffer delay flag is not cleared when clearing the

this.

CVE-2024-50195,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

posix-clock: Fix missing timespec64 check in pc_clock_settime()

As Andrew pointed out, it will make sense that the PTP core
checked timespec64 struct's tv_sec and tv_nsec range before calling
ptp->info->settime64().

As the man manual of clock_settime() said, if tp.tv_sec is negative or
tp.tv_nsec is outside the range [0..999,999,999], it should return EINVAL,
which include dynamic clocks which handles PTP clock, and the condition is
consistent with timespec64_valid(). As Thomas suggested, timespec64_valid()
only check the timespec is valid, but not ensure that the time is
in a valid range, so check it ahead using timespec64_valid_strict()
in pc_clock_settime() and return -EINVAL if not valid.

There are some drivers that use tp->tv_sec and tp->tv_nsec directly to
write registers without validity checks and assume that the higher layer
has checked it, which is dangerous and will benefit from this, such as
hclge_ptp_settime(), igb_ptp_settime_i210(), _rcar_gen4_ptp_settime(),

CVE-2024-50196,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

pinctrl: ocelot: fix system hang on level based interrupts

The current implementation only calls chained_irq_enter() and
chained_irq_exit() if it detects pending interrupts.

```
for (i = 0; i < info->stride; i++) {
	uregmap_read(info->map, id_reg + 4 * i, &reg);
	if (!reg)
		continue;

	chained_irq_enter(parent_chip, desc);
```

However, in case of GPIO pin configured in level mode and the parent
controller configured in edge mode, GPIO interrupt might be lowered by the
hardware. In the result, if the interrupt is short enough, the parent
interrupt is still pending while the GPIO interrupt is cleared;
chained_irq_enter() never gets called and the system hangs trying to
service the parent interrupt.

Moving chained_irq_enter() and chained_irq_exit() outside the for loop
ensures that they are called even when GPIO interrupt is lowered by the
hardware.

The similar code with chained_irq_enter() / chained_irq_exit() functions
wrapping interrupt checking loop may be found in many other drivers:

grep -r -A 10 chained_irq_enter drivers/pinctrl

CVE-2024-26718,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dm-crypt, dm-verity: disable tasklets

Tasklets have an inherent problem with memory corruption. The function
tasklet_action_common calls tasklet_trylock, then it calls the tasklet
callback and then it calls tasklet_unlock. If the tasklet callback frees
the structure that contains the tasklet or if it calls some code that may
free it, tasklet_unlock will write into free memory.

The commits 8e14f610159d and d9a02e016aaf try to fix it for dm-crypt, but
it is not a sufficient fix and the data corruption can still happen [1].
There is no fix for dm-verity and dm-verity will write into free memory
with every tasklet-processed bio.

There will be atomic workqueues implemented in the kernel 6.9 [2]. They
will have better interface and they will not suffer from the memory
corruption problem.

But we need something that stops the memory corruption now and that can be
backported to the stable kernels. So, I'm proposing this commit that
disables tasklets in both dm-crypt and dm-verity. This commit doesn't
remove the tasklet support, because the tasklet code will be reused when
atomic workqueues will be implemented.

CVE-2024-41066,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ibmvnic: Add tx check to prevent skb leak

Below is a summary of how the driver stores a reference to an skb during
transmit:
    tx_buff[free_map[consumer_index]]->skb = new_skb;
    free_map[consumer_index] = IBMVNIC_INVALID_MAP;
    consumer_index ++;
Where variable data looks like this:
    free_map == [4, IBMVNIC_INVALID_MAP, IBMVNIC_INVALID_MAP, 0, 3]
                                               	consumer_index^
    tx_buff == [skb=null, skb=<ptr>, skb=<ptr>, skb=null, skb=null]

The driver has checks to ensure that free_map[consumer_index] pointed to
a valid index but there was no check to ensure that this index pointed
to an unused/null skb address. So, if, by some chance, our free_map and
tx_buff lists become out of sync then we were previously risking an
skb memory leak. This could then cause tcp congestion control to stop
sending packets, eventually leading to ETIMEDOUT.

Therefore, add a conditional to ensure that the skb address is null. If
not then warn the user (because this is still a bug that should be
patched) and free the old pointer to prevent memleak/tcp problems.",'-,5.5,6021727,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7293-1),5,5,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 27, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,197464197,demo-linux2ad-4.portugal.pt,10.200.3.4,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:ae3,Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7293-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7293-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,30,3,"Feb 26, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",Ubuntu,CRITICAL,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 20.04.6,'-,'-,12,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,236,,"#table cols=""3""

In the commit aee2424246f9 (""RDMA/iwcm: Fix a use-after-free related to
destroying CM IDs""), the function flush_workqueue is invoked to flush the
work queue iwcm_wq.

But at that time, the work queue iwcm_wq was created via the function
alloc_ordered_workqueue without the flag WQ_MEM_RECLAIM.

Because the current process is trying to flush the whole iwcm_wq, if
iwcm_wq doesn't have the flag WQ_MEM_RECLAIM, verify that the current
process is not reclaiming memory or running on a workqueue which doesn't
have the flag WQ_MEM_RECLAIM as that can break forward-progress guarantee
leading to a deadlock.

CVE-2024-49867,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: wait for fixup workers before stopping cleaner kthread during umount

During unmount, at close_ctree(), we have the following steps in this order:

1) Park the cleaner kthread - this doesn't destroy the kthread, it basically
   halts its execution (wake ups against it work but do nothing);

2) We stop the cleaner kthread - this results in freeing the respective
   struct task_struct;

3) We call btrfs_stop_all_workers() which waits for any jobs running in all
   the work queues and then free the work queues.

Syzbot reported a case where a fixup worker resulted in a crash when doing
a delayed iput on its inode while attempting to wake up the cleaner at
btrfs_add_delayed_iput(), because the task_struct of the cleaner kthread
was already freed. This can happen during unmount because we don't wait
for any fixup workers still running before we call kthread_stop() against
the cleaner kthread, which stops and free all its resources.

Fix this by waiting for any fixup workers at close_ctree() before we call
kthread_stop() against the cleaner and run pending delayed iputs.

The stack traces reported by syzbot were the following:

[CAUSE]
The allocation failure happens at the start_transaction() inside
prepare_to_relocate(), and during the error handling we call
unset_reloc_control(), which makes fs_info->balance_ctl to be NULL.

Then we continue the error path cleanup in btrfs_balance() by calling
reset_balance_state() which will call del_balance_item() to fully delete
the balance item in the root tree.

However during the small window between set_reloc_contrl() and
unset_reloc_control(), we can have a subvolume tree update and created a
reloc_root for that subvolume.

Then we go into the final btrfs_commit_transaction() of
del_balance_item(), and into btrfs_update_reloc_root() inside
commit_fs_roots().

That function checks if fs_info->reloc_ctl is in the merge_reloc_tree
stage, but since fs_info->reloc_ctl is NULL, it results a NULL pointer
dereference.

[FIX]
Just add extra check on fs_info->reloc_ctl inside
btrfs_update_reloc_root(), before checking
fs_info->reloc_ctl->merge_reloc_tree.

That DEAD_RELOC_TREE handling is to prevent further modification to the
reloc tree during merge stage, but since there is no reloc_ctl at all,
we do not need to bother that.",'-,5.5,6021727,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7293-1),5,5,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 27, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,197464197,demo-linux2ad-4.portugal.pt,10.200.3.4,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:ae3,Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7293-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7293-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,30,3,"Feb 26, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",Ubuntu,CRITICAL,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 20.04.6,'-,'-,12,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,236,,"#table cols=""3""

is being searched in ftrace pages of some module, but those ftrace pages
at the same time is being freed in ftrace_release_mod() as the
corresponding module is being deleted:

To fix this issue:
  1. Hold rcu lock as accessing ftrace pages in ftrace_location_range();
  2. Use ftrace_location_range() instead of lookup_rec() in
     ftrace_location();
  3. Call synchronize_rcu() before freeing any ftrace pages both in

release the corresponding resources. During the second calling, num_VFs
is not 0 and the resource release function is called. However, the
corresponding resource has been released during the first invoking.

media: dvbdev: prevent the risk of out of memory access

The dvbdev contains a static variable used to store dvb minors.

The behavior of it depends if CONFIG_DVB_DYNAMIC_MINORS is set
or not. When not set, dvb_register_device() won't check for
boundaries, as it will rely that a previous call to
dvb_register_adapter() would already be enforcing it.

On a similar way, dvb_device_open() uses the assumption
that the register functions already did the needed checks.

calls. This also generate warnings on static check analysers
like Coverity.

Currently we have a global spi_add_lock which we take when adding new

itself a SPI controller and triggers the instantiation of further SPI
devices we trigger a deadlock as we try to register and instantiate
those devices while in the process of doing so for the parent controller

CVE-2024-50194,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64: probes: Fix uprobes for big-endian kernels

The arm64 uprobes code is broken for big-endian kernels as it doesn't
convert the in-memory instruction encoding (which is always
little-endian) into the kernel's native endianness before analyzing and
simulating instructions. This may result in a few distinct problems:

* The kernel may may erroneously reject probing an instruction which can
  safely be probed.

* The kernel may erroneously erroneously permit stepping an
  instruction out-of-line when that instruction cannot be stepped
  out-of-line safely.

* The kernel may erroneously simulate instruction incorrectly dur to
  interpretting the byte-swapped encoding.

The endianness mismatch isn't caught by the compiler or sparse because:

* The arch_uprobe::{insn,ixol} fields are encoded as arrays of u8, so
  the compiler and sparse have no idea these contain a little-endian
  32-bit value. The core uprobes code populates these with a memcpy()
  which similarly does not handle endianness.

* While the uprobe_opcode_t type is an alias for __le32, both
  arch_uprobe_analyze_insn() and arch_uprobe_skip_sstep() cast from u8[]
  to the similarly-named probe_opcode_t, which is an alias for u32.
  Hence there is no endianness conversion warning.

Fix this by changing the arch_uprobe::{insn,ixol} fields to __le32 and
adding the appropriate __le32_to_cpu() conversions prior to consuming
the instruction encoding. The core uprobes copies these fields as opaque
ranges of bytes, and so is unaffected by this change.

At the same time, remove MAX_UINSN_BYTES and consistently use
AARCH64_INSN_SIZE for clarity.

CVE-2024-47740,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

f2fs: Require FMODE_WRITE for atomic write ioctls

The F2FS ioctls for starting and committing atomic writes check for
inode_owner_or_capable(), but this does not give LSMs like SELinux or
Landlock an opportunity to deny the write access - if the caller's FSUID
matches the inode's UID, inode_owner_or_capable() immediately returns true.

There are scenarios where LSMs want to deny a process the ability to write
particular files, even files that the FSUID of the process owns; but this
can currently partially be bypassed using atomic write ioctls in two ways:

 - F2FS_IOC_START_ATOMIC_REPLACE + F2FS_IOC_COMMIT_ATOMIC_WRITE can
   truncate an inode to size 0
 - F2FS_IOC_START_ATOMIC_WRITE + F2FS_IOC_ABORT_ATOMIC_WRITE can revert
   changes another process concurrently made to a file

Fix it by requiring FMODE_WRITE for these operations, just like for
F2FS_IOC_MOVE_RANGE. Since any legitimate caller should only be using these
ioctls when intending to write into the file, that seems unlikely to break
anything.",'-,'-,6021727,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7293-1),5,5,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 27, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,197464197,demo-linux2ad-4.portugal.pt,10.200.3.4,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:ae3,Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7293-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7293-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,'-,3,"Feb 26, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",Ubuntu,CRITICAL,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 20.04.6,'-,'-,12,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,236,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-47699,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nilfs2: fix potential null-ptr-deref in nilfs_btree_insert()

Patch series ""nilfs2: fix potential issues with empty b-tree nodes"".

This series addresses three potential issues with empty b-tree nodes that
can occur with corrupted filesystem images, including one recently
discovered by syzbot.


This patch (of 3):

If a b-tree is broken on the device, and the b-tree height is greater than
2 (the level of the root node is greater than 1) even if the number of
child nodes of the b-tree root is 0, a NULL pointer dereference occurs in
nilfs_btree_prepare_insert(), which is called from nilfs_btree_insert().

This is because, when the number of child nodes of the b-tree root is 0,
nilfs_btree_do_lookup() does not set the block buffer head in any of
path[x].bp_bh, leaving it as the initial value of NULL, but if the level
of the b-tree root node is greater than 1, nilfs_btree_get_nonroot_node(),
which accesses the buffer memory of path[x].bp_bh, is called.

Fix this issue by adding a check to nilfs_btree_root_broken(), which
performs sanity checks when reading the root node from the device, to
detect this inconsistency.

CVE-2024-49878,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

resource: fix region_intersects() vs add_memory_driver_managed()

On a system with CXL memory, the resource tree (/proc/iomem) related to
CXL memory may look like something as follows.

490000000-50fffffff : CXL Window 0
  490000000-50fffffff : region0
    490000000-50fffffff : dax0.0
      490000000-50fffffff : System RAM (kmem)

Because drivers/dax/kmem.c calls add_memory_driver_managed() during
onlining CXL memory, which makes ""System RAM (kmem)"" a descendant of ""CXL
Window X"".  This confuses region_intersects(), which expects all ""System
RAM"" resources to be at the top level of iomem_resource.  This can lead to
bugs.

For example, when the following command line is executed to write some
memory in CXL memory range via /dev/mem,

 $ dd if=data of=/dev/mem bs=$((1 << 10)) seek=$((0x490000000 >> 10)) count=1
 dd: error writing '/dev/mem': Bad address
 1+0 records in
 0+0 records out
 0 bytes copied, 0.0283507 s, 0.0 kB/s

the command fails as expected.  However, the error code is wrong.  It
should be ""Operation not permitted"" instead of ""Bad address"".  More
seriously, the /dev/mem permission checking in devmem_is_allowed() passes
incorrectly.  Although the accessing is prevented later because ioremap()
isn't allowed to map system RAM, it is a potential security issue.  During
command executing, the following warning is reported in the kernel log for
calling ioremap() on system RAM.

 ioremap on RAM at 0x0000000490000000 - 0x0000000490000fff

  entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x4b/0x53

The details of command execution process are as follows.  In the above
resource tree, ""System RAM"" is a descendant of ""CXL Window 0"" instead of a
top level resource.  So, region_intersects() will report no System RAM
resources in the CXL memory region incorrectly, because it only checks the
top level resources.  Consequently, devmem_is_allowed() will return 1
(allow access via /dev/mem) for CXL memory region incorrectly. 
Fortunately, ioremap() doesn't allow to map System RAM and reject the
access.

So, region_intersects() needs to be fixed to work correctly with the
resource tree with ""System RAM"" not at top level as above.  To fix it, if
we found a unmatched resource in the top level, we will continue to search
matched resources in its descendant resources.  So, we will not miss any
matched resources in resource tree anymore.

In the new implementation, an example resource tree

|------------- ""CXL Window 0"" ------------|
|-- ""System RAM"" --|

will behave similar as the following fake resource tree for
region_intersects(, IORESOURCE_SYSTEM_RAM, ),

|-- ""System RAM"" --||-- ""CXL Window 0a"" --|

Where ""CXL Window 0a"" is part of the original ""CXL Window 0"" that

CVE-2024-50229,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nilfs2: fix potential deadlock with newly created symlinks

Syzbot reported that page_symlink(), called by nilfs_symlink(), triggers
memory reclamation involving the filesystem layer, which can result in
circular lock dependencies among the reader/writer semaphore
nilfs->ns_segctor_sem, s_writers percpu_rwsem (intwrite) and the
fs_reclaim pseudo lock.

This is because after commit 21fc61c73c39 (""don't put symlink bodies in
pagecache into highmem""), the gfp flags of the page cache for symbolic
links are overwritten to GFP_KERNEL via inode_nohighmem().

This is not a problem for symlinks read from the backing device, because
the __GFP_FS flag is dropped after inode_nohighmem() is called.  However,
when a new symlink is created with nilfs_symlink(), the gfp flags remain
overwritten to GFP_KERNEL.  Then, memory allocation called from
page_symlink() etc.  triggers memory reclamation including the FS layer,
which may call nilfs_evict_inode() or nilfs_dirty_inode().  And these can
cause a deadlock if they are called while nilfs->ns_segctor_sem is held:

Fix this issue by dropping the __GFP_FS flag from the page cache GFP flags
of newly created symlinks in the same way that nilfs_new_inode() and
__nilfs_read_inode() do, as a workaround until we adopt nofs allocation
scope consistently or improve the locking constraints.",'-,5.5,6021727,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7293-1),5,5,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 27, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,197464197,demo-linux2ad-4.portugal.pt,10.200.3.4,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:ae3,Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7293-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7293-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,30,3,"Feb 26, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",Ubuntu,CRITICAL,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 20.04.6,'-,'-,12,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,236,,"#table cols=""3""

drm/vmwgfx: Fix a deadlock in dma buf fence polling

Introduce a version of the fence ops that on release doesn't remove
the fence from the pending list, and thus doesn't require a lock to
fix poll->fence wait->fence unref deadlocks.

vmwgfx overwrites the wait callback to iterate over the list of all
fences and update their status, to do that it holds a lock to prevent
the list modifcations from other threads. The fence destroy callback
both deletes the fence and removes it from the list of pending
fences, for which it holds a lock.

dma buf polling cb unrefs a fence after it's been signaled: so the poll
calls the wait, which signals the fences, which are being destroyed.
The destruction tries to acquire the lock on the pending fences list
which it can never get because it's held by the wait from which it
was called.

There is a WARNING in iwl_trans_wait_tx_queues_empty() (that was

wait for TX queues to become empty after firmware died. Clearly,
we can't expect anything from the firmware after it's declared dead.

be a good idea to stop the flow earlier, the flush functions do some

mm: avoid leaving partial pfn mappings around in error case

As Jann points out, PFN mappings are special, because unlike normal
memory mappings, there is no lifetime information associated with the
mapping - it is just a raw mapping of PFNs with no reference counting of
a 'struct page'.

That's all very much intentional, but it does mean that it's easy to
mess up the cleanup in case of errors.  Yes, a failed mmap() will always
eventually clean up any partial mappings, but without any explicit
lifetime in the page table mapping itself, it's very easy to do the
error handling in the wrong order.

In particular, it's easy to mistakenly free the physical backing store
before the page tables are actually cleaned up and (temporarily) have
stale dangling PTE entries.

To make this situation less error-prone, just make sure that any partial
pfn mapping is torn down early, before any other error handling.",'-,5.5,6021727,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7293-1),5,5,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 27, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,197464197,demo-linux2ad-4.portugal.pt,10.200.3.4,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:ae3,Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7293-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7293-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,37,3,"Feb 26, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",Ubuntu,CRITICAL,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 20.04.6,'-,'-,12,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,236,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-50039,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/sched: accept TCA_STAB only for root qdisc

Most qdiscs maintain their backlog using qdisc_pkt_len(skb)
on the assumption it is invariant between the enqueue()
and dequeue() handlers.

Unfortunately syzbot can crash a host rather easily using
a TBF + SFQ combination, with an STAB on SFQ [1]

We can't support TCA_STAB on arbitrary level, this would
require to maintain per-qdisc storage.

CVE-2024-47706,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

block, bfq: fix possible UAF for bfqq->bic with merge chain

1) initial state, three tasks:

		Process 1       Process 2	Process 3
		 (BIC1)          (BIC2)		 (BIC3)
		  |  ?            |  ?		  |  ?
		  |  |            |  |		  |  |
		  V  |            V  |		  V  |
		  bfqq1           bfqq2		  bfqq3
process ref:	   1		    1		    1

2) bfqq1 merged to bfqq2:

		Process 1       Process 2	Process 3
		 (BIC1)          (BIC2)		 (BIC3)
		  |               |		  |  ?
		  \--------------\|		  |  |
		                  V		  V  |
		  bfqq1--------->bfqq2		  bfqq3
process ref:	   0		    2		    1

3) bfqq2 merged to bfqq3:

		Process 1       Process 2	Process 3
		 (BIC1)          (BIC2)		 (BIC3)
	 here -> ?                |		  |
		  \--------------\ \-------------\|
		                  V		  V
		  bfqq1--------->bfqq2---------->bfqq3
process ref:	   0		    1		    3

In this case, IO from Process 1 will get bfqq2 from BIC1 first, and then
get bfqq3 through merge chain, and finially handle IO by bfqq3.
Howerver, current code will think bfqq2 is owned by BIC1, like initial
state, and set bfqq2->bic to BIC1.

bfq_insert_request
-> by Process 1
 bfqq = bfq_init_rq(rq)
  bfqq = bfq_get_bfqq_handle_split
   bfqq = bic_to_bfqq
   -> get bfqq2 from BIC1
 bfqq->ref++
 rq->elv.priv[0] = bic
 rq->elv.priv[1] = bfqq
 if (bfqq_process_refs(bfqq) == 1)
  bfqq->bic = bic
  -> record BIC1 to bfqq2

  __bfq_insert_request
   new_bfqq = bfq_setup_cooperator
   -> get bfqq3 from bfqq2->new_bfqq
   bfqq_request_freed(bfqq)
   new_bfqq->ref++
   rq->elv.priv[1] = new_bfqq
   -> handle IO by bfqq3

Fix the problem by checking bfqq is from merge chain fist. And this
might fix a following problem reported by our syzkaller(unreproducible):

CVE-2024-50278,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dm cache: fix potential out-of-bounds access on the first resume

Out-of-bounds access occurs if the fast device is expanded unexpectedly
before the first-time resume of the cache table. This happens because
expanding the fast device requires reloading the cache table for
cache_create to allocate new in-core data structures that fit the new
size, and the check in cache_preresume is not performed during the
first resume, leading to the issue.

Reproduce steps:

1. prepare component devices:

dmsetup create cmeta --table ""0 8192 linear /dev/sdc 0""
dmsetup create cdata --table ""0 65536 linear /dev/sdc 8192""
dmsetup create corig --table ""0 524288 linear /dev/sdc 262144""
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/mapper/cmeta bs=4k count=1 oflag=direct

2. load a cache table of 512 cache blocks, and deliberately expand the
   fast device before resuming the cache, making the in-core data
   structures inadequate.

dmsetup create cache --notable
dmsetup reload cache --table ""0 524288 cache /dev/mapper/cmeta \
/dev/mapper/cdata /dev/mapper/corig 128 2 metadata2 writethrough smq 0""
dmsetup reload cdata --table ""0 131072 linear /dev/sdc 8192""
dmsetup resume cdata
dmsetup resume cache

3. suspend the cache to write out the in-core dirty bitset and hint
   array, leading to out-of-bounds access to the dirty bitset at offset
   0x40:

dmsetup suspend cache

CVE-2024-47709,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

can: bcm: Clear bo->bcm_proc_read after remove_proc_entry().

syzbot reported a warning in bcm_release(). [0]

The blamed change fixed another warning that is triggered when
connect() is issued again for a socket whose connect()ed device has
been unregistered.

However, if the socket is just close()d without the 2nd connect(), the
remaining bo->bcm_proc_read triggers unnecessary remove_proc_entry()
in bcm_release().

Let's clear bo->bcm_proc_read after remove_proc_entry() in bcm_notify().

CVE-2024-50279,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dm cache: fix out-of-bounds access to the dirty bitset when resizing

dm-cache checks the dirty bits of the cache blocks to be dropped when
shrinking the fast device, but an index bug in bitset iteration causes
out-of-bounds access.

Reproduce steps:

1. create a cache device of 1024 cache blocks (128 bytes dirty bitset)

dmsetup create cmeta --table ""0 8192 linear /dev/sdc 0""
dmsetup create cdata --table ""0 131072 linear /dev/sdc 8192""
dmsetup create corig --table ""0 524288 linear /dev/sdc 262144""
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/mapper/cmeta bs=4k count=1 oflag=direct
dmsetup create cache --table ""0 524288 cache /dev/mapper/cmeta \
/dev/mapper/cdata /dev/mapper/corig 128 2 metadata2 writethrough smq 0""

2. shrink the fast device to 512 cache blocks, triggering out-of-bounds
   access to the dirty bitset (offset 0x80)

dmsetup suspend cache
dmsetup reload cdata --table ""0 65536 linear /dev/sdc 8192""
dmsetup resume cdata
dmsetup resume cache

smb: client: fix OOBs when building SMB2_IOCTL request

When using encryption, either enforced by the server or when using

CVE-2024-50273,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: reinitialize delayed ref list after deleting it from the list

At insert_delayed_ref() if we need to update the action of an existing
ref to BTRFS_DROP_DELAYED_REF, we delete the ref from its ref head's
ref_add_list using list_del(), which leaves the ref's add_list member
not reinitialized, as list_del() sets the next and prev members of the
list to LIST_POISON1 and LIST_POISON2, respectively.

If later we end up calling drop_delayed_ref() against the ref, which can
happen during merging or when destroying delayed refs due to a transaction
abort, we can trigger a crash since at drop_delayed_ref() we call
list_empty() against the ref's add_list, which returns false since
the list was not reinitialized after the list_del() and as a consequence
we call list_del() again at drop_delayed_ref(). This results in an
invalid list access since the next and prev members are set to poison
pointers, resulting in a splat if CONFIG_LIST_HARDENED and
CONFIG_DEBUG_LIST are set or invalid poison pointer dereferences
otherwise.

So fix this by deleting from the list with list_del_init() instead.",'-,5.5,6021727,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7293-1),5,5,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 27, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,197464197,demo-linux2ad-4.portugal.pt,10.200.3.4,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:ae3,Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7293-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7293-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,'-,3,"Feb 26, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",Ubuntu,CRITICAL,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 20.04.6,'-,'-,12,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,236,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-49985,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

i2c: stm32f7: Do not prepare/unprepare clock during runtime suspend/resume

In case there is any sort of clock controller attached to this I2C bus
controller, for example Versaclock or even an AIC32x4 I2C codec, then
an I2C transfer triggered from the clock controller clk_ops .prepare
callback may trigger a deadlock on drivers/clk/clk.c prepare_lock mutex.

This is because the clock controller first grabs the prepare_lock mutex
and then performs the prepare operation, including its I2C access. The
I2C access resumes this I2C bus controller via .runtime_resume callback,
which calls clk_prepare_enable(), which attempts to grab the prepare_lock
mutex again and deadlocks.

Since the clock are already prepared since probe() and unprepared in
remove(), use simple clk_enable()/clk_disable() calls to enable and
disable the clock on runtime suspend and resume, to avoid hitting the
prepare_lock mutex.",'-,5.5,6021727,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7293-1),5,5,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 27, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,197464197,demo-linux2ad-4.portugal.pt,10.200.3.4,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:ae3,Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7293-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7293-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,30,3,"Feb 26, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",Ubuntu,CRITICAL,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 20.04.6,'-,'-,12,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,236,,"#table cols=""3""

CVE-2024-49982,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

aoe: fix the potential use-after-free problem in more places

For fixing CVE-2023-6270, f98364e92662 (""aoe: fix the potential
use-after-free problem in aoecmd_cfg_pkts"") makes tx() calling dev_put()
instead of doing in aoecmd_cfg_pkts(). It avoids that the tx() runs
into use-after-free.

Then Nicolai Stange found more places in aoe have potential use-after-free
problem with tx(). e.g. revalidate(), aoecmd_ata_rw(), resend(), probe()
and aoecmd_cfg_rsp(). Those functions also use aoenet_xmit() to push
packet to tx queue. So they should also use dev_hold() to increase the
refcnt of skb->dev.

On the other hand, moving dev_put() to tx() causes that the refcnt of
skb->dev be reduced to a negative value, because corresponding
dev_hold() are not called in revalidate(), aoecmd_ata_rw(), resend(),
probe(), and aoecmd_cfg_rsp().

wifi: wilc1000: fix potential RCU dereference issue in wilc_parse_join_bss_param

In the `wilc_parse_join_bss_param` function, the TSF field of the `ies`
structure is accessed after the RCU read-side critical section is
unlocked. According to RCU usage rules, this is illegal. Reusing this
pointer can lead to unpredictable behavior, including accessing memory
that has been updated or causing use-after-free issues.

This possible bug was identified using a static analysis tool developed
by myself, specifically designed to detect RCU-related issues.

To address this, the TSF value is now stored in a local variable
`ies_tsf` before the RCU lock is released. The `param->tsf_lo` field is
then assigned using this local variable, ensuring that the TSF value is

Let's assume there's a inode (ie ino 261) with i_count 1 is
called by iput(), and there's a concurrent thread calling
generic_shutdown_super().

cpu0:                              cpu1:
iput() // i_count is 1
  ->spin_lock(inode)
  ->dec i_count to 0
  ->iput_final()                    generic_shutdown_super()
    ->__inode_add_lru()               ->evict_inodes()
      // cause some reason[2]           ->if (atomic_read(inode->i_count)) continue;
      // return before                  // inode 261 passed the above check
      // list_lru_add_obj()             // and then schedule out
   ->spin_unlock()
// note here: the inode 261
// was still at sb list and hash list,
// and I_FREEING|I_WILL_FREE was not been set

btrfs_iget()
  // after some function calls
  ->find_inode()
    // found the above inode 261
    ->spin_lock(inode)
   // check I_FREEING|I_WILL_FREE
   // and passed
      ->__iget()
    ->spin_unlock(inode)                // schedule back
                                        ->spin_lock(inode)
                                        // check (I_NEW|I_FREEING|I_WILL_FREE) flags,
                                        // passed and set I_FREEING
iput()                                  ->spin_unlock(inode)
  ->spin_lock(inode)			  ->evict()
  // dec i_count to 0
  ->iput_final()
    ->spin_unlock()
    ->evict()

Now, we have two threads simultaneously evicting
the same inode, which may trigger the BUG(inode->i_state & I_CLEAR)
statement both within clear_inode() and iput().

To fix the bug, recheck the inode->i_count after holding i_lock.
Because in the most scenarios, the first check is valid, and
the overhead of spin_lock() can be reduced.

If there is any misunderstanding, please let me know, thanks.

CVE-2024-50045,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: br_netfilter: fix panic with metadata_dst skb

Fix a kernel panic in the br_netfilter module when sending untagged
traffic via a VxLAN device.
This happens during the check for fragmentation in br_nf_dev_queue_xmit.

It is dependent on:
1) the br_netfilter module being loaded;
2) net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables set to 1;
3) a bridge with a VxLAN (single-vxlan-device) netdevice as a bridge port;
4) untagged frames with size higher than the VxLAN MTU forwarded/flooded

When forwarding the untagged packet to the VxLAN bridge port, before
the netfilter hooks are called, br_handle_egress_vlan_tunnel is called and
changes the skb_dst to the tunnel dst. The tunnel_dst is a metadata type
of dst, i.e., skb_valid_dst(skb) is false, and metadata->dst.dev is NULL.

Then in the br_netfilter hooks, in br_nf_dev_queue_xmit, there's a check
for frames that needs to be fragmented: frames with higher MTU than the
VxLAN device end up calling br_nf_ip_fragment, which in turns call
ip_skb_dst_mtu.

The ip_dst_mtu tries to use the skb_dst(skb) as if it was a valid dst
with valid dst->dev, thus the crash.

This case was never supported in the first place, so drop the packet
instead.

nilfs2: propagate directory read errors from nilfs_find_entry()

The root cause of this problem is that in nilfs_find_entry(), which
searches for directory entries, ignores errors when loading a directory
page/folio via nilfs_get_folio() fails.

If the filesystem images is corrupted, and the i_size of the directory
inode is large, and the directory page/folio is successfully read but
fails the sanity check, for example when it is zero-filled,
nilfs_check_folio() may continue to spit out error messages in bursts.

Fix this issue by propagating the error to the callers when loading a

CVE-2024-49949,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: avoid potential underflow in qdisc_pkt_len_init() with UFO

After commit 7c6d2ecbda83 (""net: be more gentle about silly gso
requests coming from user"") virtio_net_hdr_to_skb() had sanity check
to detect malicious attempts from user space to cook a bad GSO packet.

Then commit cf9acc90c80ec (""net: virtio_net_hdr_to_skb: count
transport header in UFO"") while fixing one issue, allowed user space
to cook a GSO packet with the following characteristic :

IPv4 SKB_GSO_UDP, gso_size=3, skb->len = 28.

When this packet arrives in qdisc_pkt_len_init(), we end up
with hdr_len = 28 (IPv4 header + UDP header), matching skb->len

Then the following sets gso_segs to 0 :

gso_segs = DIV_ROUND_UP(skb->len - hdr_len,
                        shinfo->gso_size);

Then later we set qdisc_skb_cb(skb)->pkt_len to back to zero :/

qdisc_skb_cb(skb)->pkt_len += (gso_segs - 1) * hdr_len;

This leads to the following crash in fq_codel [1]

qdisc_pkt_len_init() is best effort, we only want an estimation
of the bytes sent on the wire, not crashing the kernel.

This patch is fixing this particular issue, a following one
adds more sanity checks for another potential bug.

gpio: prevent potential speculation leaks in gpio_device_get_desc()

Userspace may trigger a speculative read of an address outside the gpio

Offset is copied from user and then used as an array index to get

CVE-2024-50096,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nouveau/dmem: Fix vulnerability in migrate_to_ram upon copy error

The `nouveau_dmem_copy_one` function ensures that the copy push command is
sent to the device firmware but does not track whether it was executed
successfully.

In the case of a copy error (e.g., firmware or hardware failure), the
copy push command will be sent via the firmware channel, and
`nouveau_dmem_copy_one` will likely report success, leading to the
`migrate_to_ram` function returning a dirty HIGH_USER page to the user.

This can result in a security vulnerability, as a HIGH_USER page that may

CVE-2024-50099,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64: probes: Remove broken LDR (literal) uprobe support

The simulate_ldr_literal() and simulate_ldrsw_literal() functions are
unsafe to use for uprobes. Both functions were originally written for
use with kprobes, and access memory with plain C accesses. When uprobes
was added, these were reused unmodified even though they cannot safely
access user memory.

There are three key problems:

1) The plain C accesses do not have corresponding extable entries, and
   thus if they encounter a fault the kernel will treat these as
   unintentional accesses to user memory, resulting in a BUG() which
   will kill the kernel thread, and likely lead to further issues (e.g.
   lockup or panic()).

2) The plain C accesses are subject to HW PAN and SW PAN, and so when
   either is in use, any attempt to simulate an access to user memory
   will fault. Thus neither simulate_ldr_literal() nor
   simulate_ldrsw_literal() can do anything useful when simulating a
   user instruction on any system with HW PAN or SW PAN.

3) The plain C accesses are privileged, as they run in kernel context,
   and in practice can access a small range of kernel virtual addresses.
   The instructions they simulate have a range of +/-1MiB, and since the
   simulated instructions must itself be a user instructions in the
   TTBR0 address range, these can address the final 1MiB of the TTBR1
   acddress range by wrapping downwards from an address in the first
   1MiB of the TTBR0 address range.

   In contemporary kernels the last 8MiB of TTBR1 address range is
   reserved, and accesses to this will always fault, meaning this is no
   worse than (1).

   Historically, it was theoretically possible for the linear map or
   vmemmap to spill into the final 8MiB of the TTBR1 address range, but
   in practice this is extremely unlikely to occur as this would
   require either:

   * Having enough physical memory to fill the entire linear map all the
     way to the final 1MiB of the TTBR1 address range.

   * Getting unlucky with KASLR randomization of the linear map such
     that the populated region happens to overlap with the last 1MiB of
     the TTBR address range.

   ... and in either case if we were to spill into the final page there
   would be larger problems as the final page would alias with error
   pointers.

Practically speaking, (1) and (2) are the big issues. Given there have
been no reports of problems since the broken code was introduced, it
appears that no-one is relying on probing these instructions with
uprobes.

Avoid these issues by not allowing uprobes on LDR (literal) and LDRSW
(literal), limiting the use of simulate_ldr_literal() and
simulate_ldrsw_literal() to kprobes. Attempts to place uprobes on LDR
(literal) and LDRSW (literal) will be rejected as
arm_probe_decode_insn() will return INSN_REJECTED. In future we can
consider introducing working uprobes support for these instructions, but
this will require more significant work.",'-,5.5,6021727,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7293-1),5,5,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 27, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,197464197,demo-linux2ad-4.portugal.pt,10.200.3.4,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:ae3,Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7293-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7293-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,30,3,"Feb 26, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",Ubuntu,CRITICAL,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 20.04.6,'-,'-,12,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,236,,"#table cols=""3""

The issue was in the reflink workfow while reserving space for inline
xattr.  The problematic function is ocfs2_reflink_xattr_inline().  By the
time this function is called the reflink tree is already recreated at the
destination inode from the source inode.  At this point, this function
reserves space for inline xattrs at the destination inode without even
checking if there is space at the root metadata block.  It simply reduces
the l_count from 243 to 227 thereby making space of 256 bytes for inline
xattr whereas the inode already has extents beyond this index (in this
case up to 230), thereby causing corruption.

The fix for this is to reserve space for inline metadata at the destination
inode before the reflink tree gets recreated. The customer has verified the
fix.",'-,5.5,6021727,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7293-1),5,5,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 27, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,197464197,demo-linux2ad-4.portugal.pt,10.200.3.4,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:ae3,Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7293-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7293-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,30,3,"Feb 26, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",Ubuntu,CRITICAL,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 20.04.6,'-,'-,12,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,236,,"#table cols=""3""

This issue was also reported by syzbot.

It can be reproduced by following these steps(more details [1]):
1. Obtain more than 32 inputs that have similar hashes, which ends with the
   pattern '0xxxxxxxe6'.
2. Reboot and add the keys obtained in step 1.

The reproducer demonstrates how this issue happened:
1. In the search_nested_keyrings function, when it iterates through the
   slots in a node(below tag ascend_to_node), if the slot pointer is meta
   and node->back_pointer != NULL(it means a root), it will proceed to
   descend_to_node. However, there is an exception. If node is the root,
   and one of the slots points to a shortcut, it will be treated as a
   keyring.
2. Whether the ptr is keyring decided by keyring_ptr_is_keyring function.
   However, KEYRING_PTR_SUBTYPE is 0x2UL, the same as
   ASSOC_ARRAY_PTR_SUBTYPE_MASK.
3. When 32 keys with the similar hashes are added to the tree, the ROOT
   has keys with hashes that are not similar (e.g. slot 0) and it splits
   NODE A without using a shortcut. When NODE A is filled with keys that
   all hashes are xxe6, the keys are similar, NODE A will split with a
   shortcut. Finally, it forms the tree as shown below, where slot 6 points
   to a shortcut.

                      NODE A
              +------>+---+
      ROOT    |       | 0 | xxe6
      +---+   |       +---+
 xxxx | 0 | shortcut  :   : xxe6
      +---+   |       +---+
 xxe6 :   :   |       |   | xxe6
      +---+   |       +---+
      | 6 |---+       :   : xxe6
      +---+           +---+
 xxe6 :   :           | f | xxe6
      +---+           +---+
 xxe6 | f |
      +---+

4. As mentioned above, If a slot(slot 6) of the root points to a shortcut,
   it may be mistakenly transferred to a key*, leading to a read
   out-of-bounds read.

To fix this issue, one should jump to descend_to_node if the ptr is a
shortcut, regardless of whether the node is root or not.

So rq_qos_wake_function() calls wake_up_process(data->task), which calls
try_to_wake_up(), which faults in raw_spin_lock_irqsave(&p->pi_lock).

p comes from data->task, and data comes from the waitqueue entry, which
is stored on the waiter's stack in rq_qos_wait(). Analyzing the core
dump with drgn, I found that the waiter had already woken up and moved
on to a completely unrelated code path, clobbering what was previously
data->task. Meanwhile, the waker was passing the clobbered garbage in
data->task to wake_up_process(), leading to the crash.

What's happening is that in between rq_qos_wake_function() deleting the
waitqueue entry and calling wake_up_process(), rq_qos_wait() is finding
that it already got a token and returning. The race looks like this:

rq_qos_wait()                           rq_qos_wake_function()

Normally, finish_wait() is supposed to synchronize against the waker.
But, as noted above, it is returning immediately because the waitqueue
entry has already been removed from the waitqueue.

The bug is that rq_qos_wake_function() is accessing the waitqueue entry
AFTER deleting it. Note that autoremove_wake_function() wakes the waiter
and THEN deletes the waitqueue entry, which is the proper order.

Fix it by swapping the order. We also need to use
list_del_init_careful() to match the list_empty_careful() in
finish_wait().",'-,4.7,6021727,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7293-1),5,5,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 27, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,197464197,demo-linux2ad-4.portugal.pt,10.200.3.4,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:ae3,Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7293-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7293-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,30,3,"Feb 26, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",Ubuntu,CRITICAL,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 20.04.6,'-,'-,12,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,236,,"#table cols=""3""

KVM: Fix a data race on last_boosted_vcpu in kvm_vcpu_on_spin()

Use {READ,WRITE}_ONCE() to access kvm->last_boosted_vcpu to ensure the
loads and stores are atomic.  In the extremely unlikely scenario the
compiler tears the stores, it's theoretically possible for KVM to attempt
to get a vCPU using an out-of-bounds index, e.g. if the write is split
into multiple 8-bit stores, and is paired with a 32-bit load on a VM with
257 vCPUs:

  CPU0                              CPU1
  last_boosted_vcpu = 0xff;

CVE-2024-47742,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

firmware_loader: Block path traversal

Most firmware names are hardcoded strings, or are constructed from fairly
constrained format strings where the dynamic parts are just some hex
numbers or such.

However, there are a couple codepaths in the kernel where firmware file
names contain string components that are passed through from a device or
semi-privileged userspace; the ones I could find (not counting interfaces
that require root privileges) are:

 - lpfc_sli4_request_firmware_update() seems to construct the firmware
   filename from ""ModelName"", a string that was previously parsed out of
   some descriptor (""Vital Product Data"") in lpfc_fill_vpd()
 - nfp_net_fw_find() seems to construct a firmware filename from a model
   name coming from nfp_hwinfo_lookup(pf->hwinfo, ""nffw.partno""), which I
   think parses some descriptor that was read from the device.
   (But this case likely isn't exploitable because the format string looks
   like ""netronome/nic_%s"", and there shouldn't be any *folders* starting
   with ""netronome/nic_"". The previous case was different because there,
   the ""%s"" is *at the start* of the format string.)
 - module_flash_fw_schedule() is reachable from the
   ETHTOOL_MSG_MODULE_FW_FLASH_ACT netlink command, which is marked as
   GENL_UNS_ADMIN_PERM (meaning CAP_NET_ADMIN inside a user namespace is
   enough to pass the privilege check), and takes a userspace-provided
   firmware name.
   (But I think to reach this case, you need to have CAP_NET_ADMIN over a
   network namespace that a special kind of ethernet device is mapped into,
   so I think this is not a viable attack path in practice.)

Fix it by rejecting any firmware names containing "".."" path components.

For what it's worth, I went looking and haven't found any USB device
drivers that use the firmware loader dangerously.",'-,7.8,6021727,Ubuntu Security Notification for Linux kernel Vulnerabilities (USN-7293-1),5,5,Confirmed,"Mar 3, 2025","Feb 27, 2025",'-,'-,ACTIVE,197464197,demo-linux2ad-4.portugal.pt,10.200.3.4,fe80:0:0:0:250:56ff:feaf:ae3,Refer to Ubuntu security advisory USN-7293-1 for updates and patch information.(https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7293-1),"PT,Cloud Agent,All,Linux-PT",No,No,35,3,"Feb 26, 2025","Feb 25, 2025",Ubuntu,CRITICAL,"High Lateral Movement,Public Exploit,CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities",Ubuntu Linux 20.04.6,'-,'-,12,"Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a security breach or affect integrity, availability, and confidentiality.",Yes,2,236,,"#table cols=""3""

wifi: iwlegacy: Clear stale interrupts before resuming device

iwl4965 fails upon resume from hibernation on my laptop. The reason
seems to be a stale interrupt which isn't being cleared out before
interrupts are enabled. We end up with a race beween the resume
trying to bring things back up, and the restart work (queued form
the interrupt handler) trying to bring things down. Eventually
the whole thing blows up.

Fix the problem by clearing out any stale interrupts before
interrupts get enabled during resume.

CVE-2024-50195,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

posix-clock: Fix missing timespec64 check in pc_clock_settime()

As Andrew pointed out, it will make sense that the PTP core
checked timespec64 struct's tv_sec and tv_nsec range before calling
ptp->info->settime64().

As the man manual of clock_settime() said, if tp.tv_sec is negative or
tp.tv_nsec is outside the range [0..999,999,999], it should return EINVAL,
which include dynamic clocks which handles PTP clock, and the condition is
consistent with timespec64_valid(). As Thomas suggested, timespec64_valid()
only check the timespec is valid, but not ensure that the time is
in a valid range, so check it ahead using timespec64_valid_strict()
in pc_clock_settime() and return -EINVAL if not valid.

There are some drivers that use tp->tv_sec and tp->tv_nsec directly to
write registers without validity checks and assume that the higher layer
has checked it, which is dangerous and will benefit from this, such as
hclge_ptp_settime(), igb_ptp_settime_i210(), _rcar_gen4_ptp_settime(),

CVE-2024-50006,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: fix i_data_sem unlock order in ext4_ind_migrate()

Fuzzing reports a possible deadlock in jbd2_log_wait_commit.

This issue is triggered when an EXT4_IOC_MIGRATE ioctl is set to require
synchronous updates because the file descriptor is opened with O_SYNC.
This can lead to the jbd2_journal_stop() function calling
jbd2_might_wait_for_commit(), potentially causing a deadlock if the
EXT4_IOC_MIGRATE call races with a write(2) system call.

This problem only arises when CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING is enabled. In this
case, the jbd2_might_wait_for_commit macro locks jbd2_handle in the
jbd2_journal_stop function while i_data_sem is locked. This triggers
lockdep because the jbd2_journal_start function might also lock the same
jbd2_handle simultaneously.

CVE-2024-9143,"Issue summary: Use of the low-level GF(2^m) elliptic curve APIs with untrusted
explicit values for the field polynomial can lead to out-of-bounds memory reads
or writes.

Impact summary: Out of bound memory writes can lead to an application crash or
even a possibility of a remote code execution, however, in all the protocols
involving Elliptic Curve Cryptography that we're aware of, either only ""named
curves"" are supported, or, if explicit curve parameters are supported, they
specify an X9.62 encoding of binary (GF(2^m)) curves that can't represent
problematic input values. Thus the likelihood of existence of a vulnerable
application is low.

In particular, the X9.62 encoding is used for ECC keys in X.509 certificates,
so problematic inputs cannot occur in the context of processing X.509
certificates.  Any problematic use-cases would have to be using an ""exotic""
curve encoding.

The affected APIs include: EC_GROUP_new_curve_GF2m(), EC_GROUP_new_from_params(),
and various supporting BN_GF2m_*() functions.

Applications working with ""exotic"" explicit binary (GF(2^m)) curve parameters,
that make it possible to represent invalid field polynomials with a zero
constant term, via the above or similar APIs, may terminate abruptly as a
result of reading or writing outside of array bounds.  Remote code execution
cannot easily be ruled out.
